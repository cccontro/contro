  abstract  = {This paper aims to show the main aspects of the polemical strategy employed by Annibal Caro in his Apologia degli academici di Banchi di Roma contro messer Lodovico Castelvetro (princeps: Parma, Viotti, 1558). By analysing the main sections of this work and the “masks” who fictionally wrote these sections (Buratto, Predella, Fedocco and Pasquino), this paper tries to show the main aspects of Caro’s polemical programme. This programme involved various aspects, such as its literary models, its language, its paratext and its fictional authorities. By showing their functioning, it is possible to better understand how the Apologia works at a macrotextual level.}

  abstract  = {This paper builds on the recent ASPIC+ formalism, to develop a general framework for argumentation with preferences. We motivate a revised definition of conflict free sets of arguments, adapt ASPIC+ to accommodate a broader range of instantiating logics, and show that under some assumptions, the resulting framework satisfies key properties and rationality postulates. We then show that the generalised framework accommodates Tarskian logic instantiations extended with preferences, and then study instantiations of the framework by classical logic approaches to argumentation. We conclude by arguing that ASPIC+ʼs modelling of defeasible inference rules further testifies to the generality of the framework, and then examine and counter recent critiques of Dungʼs framework and its extensions to accommodate preferences.}

  abstract  = {This article gives a tutorial introduction to the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. The philosophical and conceptual underpinnings of ASPIC+ are discussed, the main definitions are illustrated with examples and several ways are discussed to instantiate the framework and to reconstruct other approaches as special cases of the framework. The ASPIC+ framework is based on two ideas: the first is that conflicts between arguments are often resolved with explicit preferences, and the second is that arguments are built with two kinds of inference rules: strict, or deductive rules, whose premises guarantee their conclusion, and defeasible rules, whose premises only create a presumption in favour of their conclusion. Accordingly, arguments can in ASPIC+ be attacked in three ways: on their uncertain premises, or on their defeasible inferences, or on the conclusions of their defeasible inferences. ASPIC+ is not a system but a framework for specifying systems. A main objective of the study of the ASPIC+ framework is to identify conditions under which instantiations of the framework satisfy logical consistency and closure properties.}

  abstract  = {Argumentation is the process of supporting claims with grounds and defending them against attack. In the last decades argumentation has become an important topic in philosophy and artificial intelligence. In philosophy, the criticisms of Toulmin and Perelman of formal logic in the 1950s and 1960s gave rise to the field of informal logic, which studies informal models of reasoning and argumentation. In artificial intelligence, formal models of argumentation have been proposed as models of commonsense reasoning and multi-agent conflict resolution. This paper discusses how the formal models resulting from this research can clarify philosophical problems and issues, including those raised in the field of informal logic. An important point will be that while formal logic in the days of Toulmin and Perelman only focused on mathematical reasoning, non-mathematical forms of reasoning can still be formalised.}

  abstract  = {A fundamental principle in cognitive linguistics is that semantics is, indeed, primarily cognitive and not a matter of relationships between language and the world (or truth conditions with respect to a model). This principle becomes especially manifest in the research into facets of meaning and grammatical organization which crucially makes use of notions such as “perspective,” “subjectivity,” or “point of view.” What these notions have in common is that they capture aspects of conceptualization that cannot be sufficiently analyzed in terms of properties of the object of conceptualization, but, in one way or another, necessarily involve a subject of conceptualization. The cover term that has come to be used for different ways of viewing a particular situation is “construal.” There are several dimensions along which construals may vary. Cognitive linguists, most notably Ron Langacker and Len Talmy, have proposed a number of classification schemes for construal phenomena, in attempts to organize them into a relatively small number of basic types. This article discusses construals, perspectivization, and subjectification.}

In addition, the NeOn Methodology framework provides (a) a glossary of processes and activities involved in the development of ontologies, (b) two ontology life cycle models, and (c) a set of methodological guidelines for different processes and activities, which are described (a) functionally, in terms of goals, inputs, outputs, and relevant constraints; (b) procedurally, by means of workflow specifications; and (c) empirically, through a set of illustrative examples.},
