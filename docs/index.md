- # How to distill an opinion

    Our project aims to formalize how personal perspectives are externalized through argumentation in dialectical contexts. What we are interested in is the *shape* of an argument: when discourse is reconstructed in terms of argumentation structures, the communicative intent of the agents involved emerges with greater clarity.

<section id="questions" markdown>
Given a dialogical agent, we can ask the following questions:

<div class="grid cards" markdown hidden>
- How is their argumentative style characterized?
- What kinds of attacks do they tend to favor?
- What reasons do they put forward during argumentation?
- What reasons are implicit in their arguments?
- How are these reasons reflected in their view of the issue at stake?

# CONTRO is designed to answer

- :custom-wind:{ .lg .middle }

    **Lean and expressive**
    We developed a lightweight ontology capable of reconstructing argumentative structures in text from minimal annotation of premises and conclusions, leveraging the inferential power of OWL reasoners.

- :custom-ruler-outline:{ .lg .middle .only-light }:custom-ruler:{ .lg .middle .only-dark }

    **Formally grounded**
    CONTRO implements the main features of ASPIC^+^, one of the most widely adopted formalisms for argumentation.

- :custom-brick-outline:{ .lg .middle .only-light }:custom-brick:{ .lg .middle .only-dark }

    **Built on design patterns**
    We chose to build upon the perspectivization ontology design pattern, extending it both extensionally and intensionally to support dialectical contexts.

- :fontawesome-solid-gears:{ .lg .middle }

    **Interoperable by design**
    By adopting DOLCEâ€™s Descriptions and Situations model, the ontology is domain agnostic and supports principled ontological assertions: it can be applied independently of the framework chosen to describe the domain.
