The most skeptical in this regard was Stephen Toulmin, who in 1958 introduced a model of argument consisting of three core elements: the claim, the grounds (evidence supporting the claim), and the warrant (the principle explaining why the grounds support the claim). The model also included optional components such as backing (support for the warrant), rebuttal (conditions under which the claim might not hold), and qualifier (indicating the strength of the claim).</p> <p>This is exemplified in Toulmin\u2019s well-known case:</p> <p>Claim: Harry is a British subject.</p> <p>Grounds: Harry was born in Bermuda.</p> <p>Warrant: A man born in Bermuda will generally be a British subject.</p> <p>Backing: Statute and case law covering nationality.</p> <p>Qualifier: Presumably.</p> <p>Rebuttal: Unless his parents were foreign diplomats, or he has renounced his nationality.</p> <p>Toulmin\u2019s emphasis on warrants and backing drew directly from the structure of legal reasoning, where the strength of an argument rests not on its formal validity but on its grounding in the accepted procedures and norms of justification within a particular field. In this way, his model emphasized that reasoning varies across disciplines, depends on context, and must be judged by practical standards, laying the groundwork for a pragmatic and normative theory of argumentation.</p> <p>Building on this approach, Douglas Walton extended the analysis of context-sensitive reasoning through a systematic catalog of argumentation schemes\u2014structured templates for common types of arguments. Each scheme includes typical premises and conclusions, along with critical questions designed to test the argument\u2019s strength and uncover hidden assumptions. For example, the appeal to expert opinion scheme can be represented as:</p> <p>E is an expert in domain D.</p> <p>E asserts that proposition P is true.</p> <p>P is within D.</p> <p>Therefore, P is true.</p> <p>To evaluate this argument, one may ask: How credible is E a source? Is E truly an expert in domain D? What exactly did E assert that implies P? Is E personally reliable? Is P consistent with what other experts assert? Is E\u2019s assertion of P based on evidence?</p> <p>Walton regarded argument schemes as dialogical devices: each argument is a move in a dialogue, and the scheme it instantiates defines the set of appropriate responses (counterarguments) to that move. Schemes such as the appeal to expert opinion model source-based reasoning, and thereby offer a casuistic refinement of Toulmin\u2019s notion of backing for warrants.</p> <pre><code>---\nconfig:\n  fontFamily: var(--md-text-font-family)\n  themeCSS: \".main text { fill: var(--md-default-fg-color) } .title text { font-weight: 700; } .labels text { font-weight: 300; } .border line { stroke: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter); }\"\n  quadrantChart:\n    chartWidth: 450\n    chartHeight: 450\n    pointTextPadding: 0\n    pointRadius: 0\n    titleFontSize: 16\n    pointLabelFontSize: 16\n  themeVariables:\n    quadrantInternalBorderStrokeFill: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter)\n    quadrantExternalBorderStrokeFill: none\n    quadrant1Fill: none\n    quadrant2Fill: none\n    quadrant3Fill: none\n    quadrant4Fill: none\n---\nquadrantChart\n    title Argumentation Theories by Formality and Normativity\n    x-axis Descriptive --&gt; Prescriptive\n    y-axis Pragmatic --&gt; Abstract\n    Phan Minh Dung: [0.35, 0.95]\n    John Pollock: [0.15, 0.75]\n    Douglas Walton: [0.45, 0.4]\n    Frans van Eemeren: [0.82, 0.25]\n    Stephen Toulmin: [0.6, 0.1]</code></pre>"}, {"location": "background/#pollocks-attacks", "title": "Pollock\u2019s attacks", "text": "<p>In the mid-1980s, John Pollock played a central role in applying defeasible reasoning to argumentation, addressing the limitations that made classical deductive logic unsuitable for representing real-world reasoning. In practice, argumentation follows the principles of non-monotonic logic, where the addition of new information, describing a more particular case, can invalidate previously valid conclusions.</p> <p>One of Pollock\u2019s key examples illustrates this:</p> <p>The object looks red.</p> <p>Therefore, the object is red.</p> <p>But the object is illuminated by a red light.</p> <p>So, it is not the case that the object would look red only if it were red.</p> <p>In this case, the object appears red and is therefore presumed to be red until it is discovered that it is illuminated by a red light. The object may still be red, but it can no longer be concluded solely from its appearance. This kind of situation cannot be represented within classical deductive logic, where valid inferences are monotonic: if a conclusion follows from a premise, it continues to follow regardless of the addition of new premises. If A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true\u2014no further information (C) can defeat B. But in everyday reasoning, conclusions are often provisional: they hold until new, relevant information defeats them. This is the core insight motivating non-monotonic logics and their application to argumentation.</p> <p>Pollock formalized defeasible reasoning by distinguishing two kinds of attacks on arguments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Undercut, such as the red-light case, which challenges the connection between premise and conclusion without offering an alternative conclusion (under those conditions, one cannot know what color the object really is).</p> </li> <li> <p>Rebuttal, or distinction, which accepts the validity of the inference A \u2192 B but introduces a new premise C that leads to conclude that the case under consideration is a special case, an exception, and therefore to reach the opposite conclusion: A \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A canonical example of the latter is the Tweety case, first introduced by Raymond Reiter in 1980:</p> <p>Tweety is a bird.</p> <p>Birds typically fly.</p> <p>Therefore, Tweety flies.</p> <p>But Tweety is a penguin.</p> <p>Penguins don\u2019t fly.</p> <p>So Tweety doesn\u2019t fly.</p> <p>Here, the initial generalization is rebutted by a specific exception. Notice also that in this case the premise Tweety is a bird is not only conceded but implicitly reaffirmed by the added information that Tweety is a penguin. This shows how deductive and defeasible reasoning can coexist within a single discourse: while the inference Tweety is a penguin \u2192 Tweety is a bird is deductively valid, the defeasible rule Birds fly is overridden by a more specific case.</p> <p>Pollock\u2019s system did not allow attacks on premises, but later formalisations recognized the need for a third type of attack to account for plausible reasoning. This attack, now known as undermining, negates an argument\u2019s non-axiomatic premise and removes the support for its conclusion. Unlike undercuts, it does not invalidate the inference itself, but the conclusion remains unsupported unless the premise is defended. Undermining is currently being investigated in the context of belief revision, as it reduces the informational base from which agents draw further inferences.</p> Three Types of Attack A B \u00acA C UnderminingC \u2192 \u00acA A B C UndercutC \u2192 \u00ac(A \u2192 B) A B C \u00acB RebuttalA \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB"}, {"location": "background/#dungs-abstract-argumentation", "title": "Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation", "text": "<p>In 1995, Phan Minh Dung introduced an abstract formalism for argumentation that separated the acceptability of arguments from both their internal structure and the specific nature of their conflicts. In his model, arguments are nodes in a directed graph connected by binary attack relations. A calculus of opposition is then applied to determine sets of acceptable arguments, called extensions, that represent rational stances if they are internally coherent (conflict-free) and externally defended. These extensions depend solely on attack and defense: a defense occurs when an argument in the set attacks an attacker of another member. The arguments of such an admissible extension are labelled as accepted, those attacked by an argument of the extension are defeated, and the others are undefined.</p> <p>This set-theoretic approach decoupled abstract from structured argumentation, revolutionizing the field and enabling further mathematical development.

Argument A structure built from a set of premises, a conclusion, and a strict or defeasible inference rule connecting them. An argument is built on the basis of an argumentation theory with a given knowledge base and argumentation system. Attack A relation between two arguments where the conclusion of one contradicts a premise, the conclusion, or the inference rule in the other. These are called undermining, rebutting, and undercutting attacks, respectively. <p>ASPIC<sup>+</sup> arguments generate abstract argumentation frameworks, to which Dung-like extension calculus can be applied to evaluate acceptability. Importantly, ASPIC<sup>+</sup> is not a specific argumentation system, but a general framework for specifying such systems.

However, he, holding a very different opinion from those fervent Roman admirers, replied that Petrarch would not have used any of the elements he noted in Caro\u2019s canzone. It is up to others to prove that Petrarch would have used them, if they wish to charge the opponent with ignorance. But since some of these elements are concisely expressed\u2014having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity\u2014and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent\u2019s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.</p> <p>First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that Petrarch would not use the words \u00abcede\u00bb, \u00abinviolata\u00bb, \u00abpropizia\u00bb, \u00abgesti\u00bb, \u00abinserte\u00bb, \u00abamene\u00bb, \u00absimulacri\u00bb, or \u00abillustri\u00bb outside of rhyme\u2014not because these words were unheard of, since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, that led him to set them aside.

Nor would he use \u00abancor essa\u00bb, since refined usage of the language does not admit \u00abesso\u00bb with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well.) But one cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well.)

[\u2026] If you were to say that Petrarch had not used them, one might believe you, for you are well-versed in vocabulary. But in saying outright that \u00abhe would not use them\u00bb, one must consider whether you have reliable authority on the matter, and what exactly you know of it; whether, by chance, as you so freely dispense the name and wisdom of Petrarch, his very spirit has entered your body. For in that case\u2014or if you had it by revelation, or by some other demonstration, provided it did not come from your own mind\u2014I am content to accept what you say; and Caro will admit he used them poorly, since he holds Petrarch as the prince of poets in our language, worthy of reverence and admiration above all others.

And to this end, would you not be satisfied with the judgment, authority, and example of those who are the masters of the art of writing\u2014the very ones from whom Petrarch and all other good writers have learned, and who should also have taught you to judge, had you read them, or read them well, or interpreted them soundly?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is not possible to know whether Petrarch would have used those words merely because he did not happen to use them.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other authors of his time used those words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although Petrarch did not use those words, the authority of other influential authors in Italian literature legitimizes their use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Those words can be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] But how can you expect an author, no matter how much he writes, to put into use every single word of his era, without leaving behind many others that are just as excellent?

Beyond this, that Petrarch has taken away from others what he himself did? That an entire language should reside in a single author? That one alone should judge it? bring it to completion? This is to hold in matters of language the very same belief one holds in matters of faith: to claim that vernacular Italian should be confined to Petrarch and Boccaccio, just as to claim that sacred Scripture is wholly contained in the Gospels and Saint Paul. [\u2026] I grant that the perfection of style\u2014though never fully realized in practice\u2014has, up to now, been found in our language particularly in Petrarch and Boccaccio. But for this, I do not wish to destroy the nature of the language itself, denying it the ability, like all others, to grow and decline. I do not wish to strip away entirely the judgment of those who have come after them and those who will come in the future.

Because this process is inherently subjective, the same occurrence can be conceptualized in multiple, sometimes conflicting ways. This contrastive dimension becomes especially salient in argumentative contexts.</p> <p>We therefore treat argumentation as a special case of perspectivisation, subject to additional logical constraints.

It focuses on the interaction between an occurrence and the agent\u2019s lens, which are blended in the concept the agent forms of the situation, shaping the meaning conveyed in discourse.</p> <p>Argumentation theory, by contrast, offers a finer account of how an agent accesses their preconceptions, which serve as tools for both interpreting and expressing a fact. It explicitly distinguishes the core components of argumentation (premises, inference rule, conclusion) from the factors that enable argument production (dialogical agent, acceptance attitude, knowledge base), grouping these within an intermediate structure (the agent\u2019s internal argumentation theory). This model clarifies an aspect absent in perspectivisation: the relation between background and lens, that is, between the knowledge base and the premises and inference rules derivable from it. It leaves out, however, how the opinion on the topic expressed in the conclusion comes to form a new blended entity, merely making it available as support for further argumentation.

This layer of abstraction enables compatibility with a range of domain ontologies, supporting flexible integration.</p> <p>In DnS, binary relations are usually modeled as roles and n-ary relations as situation descriptions. We assigned roles to the entities outside the scope of our domain: for example, an eventuality may function as the topic of a perspective, while an agent will act as a dialogical agent within an argumentative exchange. On the other hand, descriptions capture the formal structure of the configuration, that is, the theoretical model of how components such as premises, conclusions, and agents relate within a given argumentative situation.</p> <p>Because we model n-ary relations, relying on domain and range constraints alone to define class membership would be inadequate.

Our aim was to ensure that the ontology could extract information that was both meaningful and faithful to its sources. To this end, we chose as our reference scenario a major literary controversy from the Italian Renaissance: the dispute between the Modenese critic Lodovico Castelvetro and the Marchigiano poet Annibal Caro. What began as a disagreement over poetic style quickly escalated into an ideological confrontation over the epistemic role of poetry, with lasting personal repercussions for those involved.</p>"}, {"location": "scenario/#sparks-of-controversy", "title": "Sparks of controversy", "text": "<p>The central decades of the 16th century were pivotal for the questione della lingua, the debate over which form of Italian should serve as the literary standard. This discourse unfolded through an interplay of literary practice and theory, with Pietro Bembo\u2019s Prose della volgar lingua (1549) marking a turning point. Bembo advocated for Petrarch and Boccaccio as respective models for poetry and prose.</p> <p>In 1553, Annibal Caro composed a Canzone dei Gigli d\u2019oro in Petrarchist style, commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese to commemorate his family\u2019s alliance with the Valois of France. Despite its modest literary quality, the poem received clamor of praise among Roman intellectuals. Perplexed by this acclaim, the Modenese jurist Aurelio Bellincini sent the text to his friend Lodovico Castelvetro for evaluation. Castelvetro, long engaged in a commentary on Petrarch\u2019s Canzoniere, dismissed the poem with a succint, seventeen-point note criticizing its inapt vocabulary and feeble metaphors.</p> <p>Although Castelvetro had expressed a desire for his views to remain private\u2014how sincerely is unclear\u2014the note nonetheless circulated at the Roman court and in other Italian cities, threatening to discredit Caro: his position as secretary to the Farnese, secured by his literary reputation despite his modest origins, depended entirely on his patrons\u2019 favor.</p> <p>Caro promptly began to prepare a defensive strategy, mobilizing influential supporters to direct harsh criticism at Castelvetro. In 1554, the Canzone appeared in print as an appendix to a collection of letters by illustrious men edited by Lodovico Dolce, accompanied by a commentary attributed to Caro and almost certainly his own work, though he always refuted its authorship. Castevetro, caught off guard by the scale of the backlash, circulated a second text titled Dichiarazione d\u2019alcune cose dell\u2019antiscritto Parere in an attempt to clarify his position.</p>"}, {"location": "scenario/#the-apologia", "title": "The Apologia", "text": "<p>It took three years of reflection for Caro to complete his definitive self-defense, the Apologia, issued anonymously in 1558. During this time, we imagine him\u2014despite professed indifference and within the narrow margins left by his official duties\u2014engaged in the careful orchestration of his polemical and literary campaign, seeking the advice of his circle and especially his friend Benedetto Varchi. \u201cI feel like the man who tried to build a house in the town square but couldn\u2019t finish it because of the sheer number of architects,\u201d he wrote to Varchi, explaining his decision to go to print despite conflicting advice: some urging caution, others warning that softening the polemical tone would spoil the effect.</p> Title page of Caro\u2019s Apologia. The specially-made device depicts a serpentine matchlock mechanism, crowned with the words vim vi, a shorthand for the maxim \u201cvim vi repellere licet\u201d (\u201cIt is permitted to repel force with force\u201d), and framed by four satyr heads. <p>By the time of publication, the Farnese had shifted to the imperial side and the encomiastic themes of the Canzone seemed inevitably dated. Nevertheless, the Apologia stands as a masterpiece of spite, blending deforming irony, pointed argumentation, rhetorical crescendos, and menacing overtones. It draws on the burlesco style Caro had cultivated in his early Florentine poetry, in the manner of Francesco Berni, before turning to more \u201cserious\u201d literary forms.</p> <p>The work mocks Castelvetro starting with its very structure: a sequence of contributions attributed to a ludicrous cast of fictitious Roman academics, all introduced by Mastro Pasquino\u2014the academy\u2019s janitor, who proclaims himself Castelvetro\u2019s accomplice in slander. Each voice takes on a distinct stylistic function: Predella delivers a point-by-point rebuttal of Castelvetro\u2019s critique; Buratto unleashes a caustic invective; and Ser Fedocco recounts an allegorical dream in which the adversary is represented as a barn owl, a caricature of the owl Castelvetro had adopted as his emblem, dwelling in a glass castle, a pun on his name, clear on the outside but foul within. The castle had appeared up in the air, disrupting the peace of Parnassus, and is demolished by order of Apollo. From the rubble, the owl is dragged in mock triumph, crowned with nettle, tried before a dwarfish embodiment of the very words Castelvetro had condemned in the Canzone, and ultimately subjected to a grotesque crucifixion.</p> <p> </p> <p>An excerpt from the outspoken index of the Apologia.</p> <p>Although the Apologia deploys a range of rhetorical strategies, Predella\u2019s contribution merits closer attention for the substance of its literary arguments.

With the Ragione, Castelvetro seizes the opportunity to display the full extent of his erudition: it is a treatise on language and poetic style that, while responding point-by-point to the Apologia, stands as an autonomous work.</p> Title page of Castelvetro\u2019s Ragione. The author is identified by his device, which depicts the owl of Athena perched on top of a toppled urn, revealed to be empty, with the Greek inscriptio kekrika (\u201cI have judged\u201d). <p>Castelvetro opens the Ragione by outlining an ideal poetic language, against which Caro\u2019s Canzone dei Gigli is assessed for both \u201cword faults\u201d and \u201cfeeling faults.\u201d The confrontation revives the ancient debate between anomalists and analogists: Caro advocated for a poetic language close to speech, while Castelvetro, accused in the Apologia of reducing the Italian vernacular to a rarefied lexicon drawn from Petrarch and Boccaccio, counters with a more rigorous conception of imitation.</p> <p>Drawing on Quintilian, he maintains that imitation is first ethical, then linguistic: no single author suffices as a model, and word usage must be validated by its survival in later authors. For Castelvetro, the authority of literary tradition defines the limits of poetic license. Innovation in vocabulary must be sparing, motivated by poetic quality, and intelligible to the audience. He dissects Caro\u2019s lexical choices on philological and historical-linguistic grounds: Latinisms, trivial etymologies, attestation in works of little value, or the availability of better alternatives all constitute faults. Etymology, alongside grammar and rhetoric, becomes a tool for deeper critical inquiry, underpinned by the belief in the systematic nature of language.</p> <p>His treatment of metaphor follows Aristotelian principles: metaphors must serve knowledge, a criterion Caro fails to meet. He also criticizes the Canzone for blurring the line between metaphor and allegory, lacking the formal discipline to prevent one figure from collapsing into the other.</p> <p>Finally, responding to Caro\u2019s charge of malice, Castelvetro reaffirms the critic\u2019s right and duty to evaluate public works, framing critique as a necessary condition of poetic discourse.</p>"}, {"location": "scenario/#legacy", "title": "Legacy", "text": "<p>By the mid-1550s, the controversy had shifted from the literary to the political level, with mounting personal consequences for Castelvetro. In 1555, he was accused of orchestrating the murder of Alberigo Longo, a poet aligned with Caro and one of the authors behind the circulating parodic verses against Castelvetro, though he consistently denied involvement. At the same time, his pseudonymous translation of a work by Melanchthon drew the Inquisition\u2019s suspicion of Reformed sympathies. Caro, both in the Apologia and through his network of influence in Rome, played an active role in amplifying those charges.</p> <p>Castelvetro\u2019s heresy trial became the object of a jurisdictional dispute between the Duchy of Ferrara and the Papacy, but he was ultimately excommunicated in absentia. In 1560, he traveled to Rome to appeal the decision, but fled to Chiavenna, then part of the Swiss Confederacy, once it became clear the outcome would not change. There, he began work on a Correzione of Varchi\u2019s Ercolano, who by 1561 had taken the place of Caro in the controversy. Death prevented him from completing it, but the work was published posthumously in Basel in 1572 by his brother, Giovanni Maria Castelvetro.</p> <p>The controversy left a lasting legacy, periodically reemerging as a touchstone for cultural tensions\u2014between Classicism and Baroque, Enlightenment and Romanticism.  As late as the 18th century, Ludovico Antonio Muratori and Giusto Fontanini reignited the debate, aligning with Castelvetro and Caro, respectively.</p> <p>At stake was not merely a question of poetic taste, but a deeper redefinition of intellectual identity that the confrontation helped crystallize. For Castelvetro, Petrarchism was adherence to the thing through the word: terse, truthful, and grounded in the study, excavation, and contemplation of the classics. Caro, by contrast, embraced a Petrarchism that revived Petrarch\u2019s imagery but not his linguistic or textual discipline: a source of artifice and allegory, and, in essence, pre-Baroque. Each came to embody a new model of intellectual: Caro, the court poet empowered by his profession; Castelvetro, the niche specialist legitimized by erudition\u2014both ultimately removed from the humanist ideal of the intellectual as philosopher shaping discourse through ideas and values.</p> <p>Castelvetro knew how to reason, and by reasoning he would crush whatever stood before him. But Caro knew how to write, and by writing he could, through the enchantment of style, replace the real image with a caricatured and grotesque puppet of his opponent and set it up in the public square for ridicule.

It usually requires background knowledge for the eventuality (and possibly the lens), as well as one or more agents conceptualising it.  A 'cut' (in the cinematic sense) emerges from a perspectivisation, which composes an eventuality with a lens, as in the example 'taxes are investments', where current taxation policies (the eventuality) is cut by shooting through the investment lens. The OWL representation of this frame includes heavy punning: each aspect of a perspectivisation is in fact modeled as a semantic role (holding between perspectivisation situations and the things involved in them, as an individual (the frame projections), as well as classes (the intensional components of the frame), since almost all aspects are frames on their turn.</p> <ul> Assertions <li> has component Attitude </li> <li> has component Background </li> <li> has component Conceptualiser </li> <li> has component Cut </li> <li> has component Eventuality </li> <li> has component Lens </li> </ul> <ul> Also defined as <li> Class </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Attitude_i", "title": "Attitude", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Attitude"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Background_i", "title": "Background", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Background"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Conceptualiser_i", "title": "Conceptualiser", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Conceptualiser"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Cut_i", "title": "Cut", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Cut"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Eventuality_i", "title": "Eventuality", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Eventuality"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Lens_i", "title": "Lens", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Lens"}, {"location": "elements/persp/#Perspectivisation_i", "title": "Perspectivisation", "text": "https://w3id.org/contro/persp#Perspectivisation"}]}
