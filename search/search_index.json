The first is an attack on the opponent\u2019s argument that relies on the (positive form of the) negated premise. Depending on whether the negated premise is an atomic proposition or a rule of inference, this attack may take the form of undermining or undercutting, respectively. Notably, this first sub-argument lacks a conclusion: it is purely destructive.</p> <p>The second sub-argument introduces a rebuttal (or distinction) that supports a contradictory conclusion. To do so, it must introduce an additional, often implicit, premise that justifies the new conclusion in light of the premises that remain acceptable. This structure exemplifies non-monotonic reasoning: attacking the premises alone is not enough to reach a different conclusion\u2014it merely invalidates the opponent\u2019s.

However, he, holding a very different opinion from those fervent Roman admirers, replied that Petrarch would not have used any of the elements he noted in Caro\u2019s canzone. It is up to others to prove that Petrarch would have used them, if they wish to charge the opponent with ignorance. But since some of these elements are concisely expressed\u2014having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity\u2014and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent\u2019s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.</p> <p>First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that Petrarch would not use the words \u00abcede\u00bb, \u00abinviolata\u00bb, \u00abpropizia\u00bb, \u00abgesti\u00bb, \u00abinserte\u00bb, \u00abamene\u00bb, \u00absimulacri\u00bb, or \u00abillustri\u00bb outside of rhyme\u2014not because these words were unheard of, since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, that led him to set them aside.

Nor would he use \u00abancor essa\u00bb, since refined usage of the language does not admit \u00abesso\u00bb with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well.) But one cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well.)

Beyond this, that Petrarch has taken away from others what he himself did? That an entire language should reside in a single author? That one alone should judge it? bring it to completion? This is to hold in matters of language the very same belief one holds in matters of faith: to claim that vernacular Italian should be confined to Petrarch and Boccaccio, just as to claim that sacred Scripture is wholly contained in the Gospels and Saint Paul.

To this end, we chose as our reference scenario a major literary controversy from the Italian Renaissance: the dispute between the Modenese critic Lodovico Castelvetro and the Marchigiano poet Annibal Caro.

Bembo advocated for Petrarch and Boccaccio as respective models for poetry and prose.</p> <p>In 1553, Annibal Caro composed a Canzone dei Gigli d\u2019oro in Petrarchist style, commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese to commemorate his family\u2019s alliance with the Valois of France. Despite its modest literary quality, the poem received clamor of praise among Roman intellectuals. Perplexed by this acclaim, the Modenese jurist Aurelio Bellincini sent the text to his friend Lodovico Castelvetro for evaluation. Castelvetro, long engaged in a commentary on Petrarch\u2019s Canzoniere, dismissed the poem with a succint, seventeen-point note criticizing its inapt vocabulary and feeble metaphors.</p> <p>Although Castelvetro had expressed a desire for his views to remain private\u2014how sincerely is unclear\u2014the note nonetheless circulated at the Roman court and in other Italian cities, threatening to discredit Caro: his position as secretary to the Farnese, secured by his literary reputation despite his modest origins, depended entirely on his patrons\u2019 favor.</p> <p>Caro promptly began to prepare a defensive strategy, mobilizing influential supporters to direct harsh criticism at Castelvetro. In 1554, the Canzone appeared in print as an appendix to a collection of letters by illustrious men edited by Lodovico Dolce, accompanied by a commentary attributed to Caro and almost certainly his own work, though he always refuted its authorship.

Nevertheless, the Apologia stands as a masterpiece of spite, blending deforming irony, pointed argumentation, rhetorical crescendos, and menacing overtones.

The castle had appeared up in the air, disrupting the peace of Parnassus, and is demolished by order of Apollo.

For Castelvetro, the authority of literary tradition defines the limits of poetic license. Innovation in vocabulary must be sparing, motivated by poetic quality, and intelligible to the audience. He dissects Caro\u2019s lexical choices on philological and historical-linguistic grounds: Latinisms, trivial etymologies, attestation in works of little value, or the availability of better alternatives all constitute faults.

Caro, both in the Apologia and through his network of influence in Rome, played an active role in amplifying both charges.</p> <p>Castelvetro\u2019s heresy trial became the object of a jurisdictional dispute between the Duchy of Ferrara and the Papacy, but he was ultimately excommunicated in absentia. In 1560, he traveled to Rome to appeal the decision, but fled to Chiavenna, then part of the Swiss Confederacy, once it became clear the outcome would not change. There, he began work on a Correzione of Varchi\u2019s Ercolano, who by 1561 had taken the place of Caro in the controversy. Death prevented him from completing it, but the work was published posthumously in Basel in 1572 by his brother, Giovanni Maria Castelvetro.</p> <p>The controversy left a lasting legacy, periodically reemerging as a touchstone for cultural tensions\u2014between Classicism and Baroque, Enlightenment and Romanticism.  As late as the 18th century, Ludovico Antonio Muratori and Giusto Fontanini reignited the debate, aligning with Castelvetro and Caro, respectively.</p> <p>At stake was not merely a question of poetic taste, but a deeper redefinition of intellectual identity that the confrontation helped crystallize. For Castelvetro, Petrarchism was adherence to the thing through the word: terse, truthful, and grounded in the study, excavation, and contemplation of the classics. Caro, by contrast, embraced a Petrarchism that revived Petrarch\u2019s imagery but not his linguistic or textual discipline: a source of artifice and allegory, and, in essence, pre-Baroque. Each came to embody a new model of intellectual: Caro, the court poet empowered by his profession; Castelvetro, the niche specialist legitimized by erudition\u2014both ultimately removed from the humanist ideal of the intellectual as philosopher shaping discourse through ideas and values.</p> <p>Castelvetro knew how to reason, and by reasoning he would crush whatever stood before him. But Caro knew how to write, and by writing he could, through the enchantment of style, replace the real image with a caricatured and grotesque puppet of his opponent and set it up in the public square for ridicule.

The debate proceeds through appeals to authority, reductio ad absurdum, irony, composite arguments, implicit premises, concessions, and distinctions\u2014rationales that are difficult to extract without analytical decomposition. The dispute resists reduction to a sequence of propositions, demanding instead a framework capable of clarifying the dialectical architecture underlying rhetorical and literary discourse: identifying the loci of disagreement, tracing the movement of claims across voices and genres, and exposing the justificatory principles at play, including those grounded in ipse dixit rather than formal inference. As such, the scenario functions not only as a historical case study but also as a stress test for the ontology\u2019s capacity to capture perspectival conflict and the rhetorical reconfiguration of meaning.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A.
