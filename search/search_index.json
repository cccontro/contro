The most skeptical in this regard was Stephen Toulmin, who in 1958 introduced a model of argument consisting of three core elements: the claim, the grounds (evidence supporting the claim), and the warrant (the principle explaining why the grounds support the claim). The model also included optional components such as backing (support for the warrant), rebuttal (conditions under which the claim might not hold), and qualifier (indicating the strength of the claim).</p> <p>This is exemplified in Toulmin\u2019s well-known case:</p> <p>Claim: Harry is a British subject.</p> <p>Grounds: Harry was born in Bermuda.</p> <p>Warrant: A man born in Bermuda will generally be a British subject.</p> <p>Backing: Statute and case law covering nationality.</p> <p>Qualifier: Presumably.</p> <p>Rebuttal: Unless his parents were foreign diplomats, or he has renounced his nationality.</p> <p>Toulmin\u2019s emphasis on warrants and backing drew directly from the structure of legal reasoning, where the strength of an argument rests not on its formal validity but on its grounding in the accepted procedures and norms of justification within a particular field. In this way, his model emphasized that reasoning varies across disciplines, depends on context, and must be judged by practical standards, laying the groundwork for a pragmatic and normative theory of argumentation.</p> <p>Building on this approach, Douglas Walton extended the analysis of context-sensitive reasoning through a systematic catalog of argumentation schemes\u2014structured templates for common types of arguments. Each scheme includes typical premises and conclusions, along with critical questions designed to test the argument\u2019s strength and uncover hidden assumptions. For example, the appeal to expert opinion scheme can be represented as:</p> <p>E is an expert in domain D.</p> <p>E asserts that proposition P is true.</p> <p>P is within D.</p> <p>Therefore, P is true.</p> <p>To evaluate this argument, one may ask: How credible is E a source? Is E truly an expert in domain D? What exactly did E assert that implies P? Is E personally reliable? Is P consistent with what other experts assert? Is E\u2019s assertion of P based on evidence?</p> <p>Walton regarded argument schemes as dialogical devices: each argument is a move in a dialogue, and the scheme it instantiates defines the set of appropriate responses (counterarguments) to that move. Schemes such as the appeal to expert opinion model source-based reasoning, and thereby offer a casuistic refinement of Toulmin\u2019s notion of backing for warrants.</p> <pre><code>---\nconfig:\n  fontFamily: var(--md-text-font-family)\n  themeCSS: \".main text { fill: var(--md-default-fg-color) } .title text { font-weight: 700; } .labels text { font-weight: 300; } .border line { stroke: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter); }\"\n  quadrantChart:\n    chartWidth: 450\n    chartHeight: 450\n    pointTextPadding: 0\n    pointRadius: 0\n    titleFontSize: 16\n    pointLabelFontSize: 16\n  themeVariables:\n    quadrantInternalBorderStrokeFill: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter)\n    quadrantExternalBorderStrokeFill: none\n    quadrant1Fill: none\n    quadrant2Fill: none\n    quadrant3Fill: none\n    quadrant4Fill: none\n---\nquadrantChart\n    title Argumentation Theories by Formality and Normativity\n    x-axis Descriptive --&gt; Prescriptive\n    y-axis Pragmatic --&gt; Abstract\n    Phan Minh Dung: [0.35, 0.95]\n    John Pollock: [0.15, 0.75]\n    Douglas Walton: [0.45, 0.4]\n    Frans van Eemeren: [0.82, 0.25]\n    Stephen Toulmin: [0.6, 0.1]</code></pre>"}, {"location": "background/#pollocks-attacks", "title": "Pollock\u2019s attacks", "text": "<p>In the mid-1980s, John Pollock played a central role in applying defeasible reasoning to argumentation, addressing the limitations that made classical deductive logic unsuitable for representing real-world reasoning. In practice, argumentation follows the principles of non-monotonic logic, where the addition of new information, describing a more particular case, can invalidate previously valid conclusions.</p> <p>One of Pollock\u2019s key examples illustrates this:</p> <p>The object looks red.</p> <p>Therefore, the object is red.</p> <p>But the object is illuminated by a red light.</p> <p>So, it is not the case that the object would look red only if it were red.</p> <p>In this case, the object appears red and is therefore presumed to be red until it is discovered that it is illuminated by a red light. The object may still be red, but it can no longer be concluded solely from its appearance. This kind of situation cannot be represented within classical deductive logic, where valid inferences are monotonic: if a conclusion follows from a premise, it continues to follow regardless of the addition of new premises. If A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true\u2014no further information (C) can defeat B. But in everyday reasoning, conclusions are often provisional: they hold until new, relevant information defeats them. This is the core insight motivating non-monotonic logics and their application to argumentation.</p> <p>Pollock formalized defeasible reasoning by distinguishing two kinds of attacks on arguments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Undercut, such as the red-light case, which challenges the connection between premise and conclusion without offering an alternative conclusion (under those conditions, one cannot know what color the object really is).</p> </li> <li> <p>Rebuttal, or distinction, which accepts the validity of the inference A \u2192 B but introduces a new premise C that leads to conclude that the case under consideration is a special case, an exception, and therefore to reach the opposite conclusion: A \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A canonical example of the latter is the Tweety case, first introduced by Raymond Reiter in 1980:</p> <p>Tweety is a bird.</p> <p>Birds typically fly.</p> <p>Therefore, Tweety flies.</p> <p>But Tweety is a penguin.</p> <p>Penguins don\u2019t fly.</p> <p>So Tweety doesn\u2019t fly.</p> <p>Here, the initial generalization is rebutted by a specific exception. Notice also that in this case the premise Tweety is a bird is not only conceded but implicitly reaffirmed by the added information that Tweety is a penguin. This shows how deductive and defeasible reasoning can coexist within a single discourse: while the inference Tweety is a penguin \u2192 Tweety is a bird is deductively valid, the defeasible rule Birds fly is overridden by a more specific case.</p> <p>Pollock\u2019s system did not allow attacks on premises, but later formalisations recognized the need for a third type of attack to account for plausible reasoning. This attack, now known as undermining, negates an argument\u2019s non-axiomatic premise and removes the support for its conclusion. Unlike undercuts, it does not invalidate the inference itself, but the conclusion remains unsupported unless the premise is defended. Undermining is currently being investigated in the context of belief revision, as it reduces the informational base from which agents draw further inferences.</p> Three Types of Attack A B \u00acA C UnderminingC \u2192 \u00acA A B C UndercutC \u2192 \u00ac(A \u2192 B) A B C \u00acB RebuttalA \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB"}, {"location": "background/#dungs-abstract-argumentation", "title": "Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation", "text": "<p>In 1995, Phan Minh Dung introduced an abstract formalism for argumentation that separated the acceptability of arguments from both their internal structure and the specific nature of their conflicts. In his model, arguments are nodes in a directed graph connected by binary attack relations. A calculus of opposition is then applied to determine sets of acceptable arguments, called extensions, that represent rational stances if they are internally coherent (conflict-free) and externally defended. These extensions depend solely on attack and defense: a defense occurs when an argument in the set attacks an attacker of another member. The arguments of such an admissible extension are labelled as accepted, those attacked by an argument of the extension are defeated, and the others are undefined.</p> <p>This set-theoretic approach decoupled abstract from structured argumentation, revolutionizing the field and enabling further mathematical development.

Argument A structure built from a set of premises, a conclusion, and a strict or defeasible inference rule connecting them. An argument is built on the basis of an argumentation theory with a given knowledge base and argumentation system. Attack A relation between two arguments where the conclusion of one contradicts a premise, the conclusion, or the inference rule in the other. These are called undermining, rebutting, and undercutting attacks, respectively. <p>ASPIC<sup>+</sup> arguments generate abstract argumentation frameworks, to which Dung-like extension calculus can be applied to evaluate acceptability. Importantly, ASPIC<sup>+</sup> is not a specific argumentation system, but a general framework for specifying such systems.

However, he, holding a very different opinion from those fervent Roman admirers, replied that Petrarch would not have used any of the elements he noted in Caro\u2019s canzone. It is up to others to prove that Petrarch would have used them, if they wish to charge the opponent with ignorance. But since some of these elements are concisely expressed\u2014having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity\u2014and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent\u2019s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.</p> <p>First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that Petrarch would not use the words \u00abcede\u00bb, \u00abinviolata\u00bb, \u00abpropizia\u00bb, \u00abgesti\u00bb, \u00abinserte\u00bb, \u00abamene\u00bb, \u00absimulacri\u00bb, or \u00abillustri\u00bb outside of rhyme, not because these words were unheard of, since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, that led him to set them aside. Nor, similarly, would he use \u00abambo\u00bb when referring to two feminine referents without the explicit and not implied accompaniment of a noun. Nor would he use \u00abancor essa\u00bb, since refined usage of the language does not admit \u201cesso\u201d or \u201cessa\u201d with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora\u00bb [Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well]. But one cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora\u00bb [Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well]. Consequently, one also cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro ne fa ancor esso\u00bb. Nor could one say \u00abmadre ancor essa\u00bb.</p> <p>Nor would he use \u00absuo merto e tuo valore\u00bb without \u201cper\u201d, since, as far as I recall from my readings, the omission of \u201cper\u201d occurs only before three nouns: \u201ctempo\u201d, \u201cgrazia\u201d, and \u201cmerc\u00e9\u201d or \u201cmercede\u201d, as in: \u00abE di notte tempo, con iscale ed altri ingegni, entr\u00f2 nella citt\u00e0 di Cortona\u00bb [And by night-time, with ladders and other devices, he entered the city of Cortona].

[\u2026] If you were to say that Petrarch had not used them, one might believe you, for you are well-versed in vocabulary. But in saying outright that \u00abhe would not use them\u00bb, one must consider whether you have reliable authority on the matter, and what exactly you know of it; whether, by chance, as you so freely dispense the name and wisdom of Petrarch, his very spirit has entered your body. For in that case, if you had it by revelation or by some other demonstration, provided it did not come from your own mind, I am content to accept what you say; and Caro will admit he used them poorly, since he holds Petrarch as the prince of poets in our language, worthy of reverence and admiration above all others. But if it is merely something you say and imagine on your own, I am under no obligation to believe it, and your imagination carries no weight.\u2014 Nor should one believe you either \u2014 you will say. Very well: on this, we are in agreement. It remains that we must agree to refer the matter (as is necessary) to third parties more knowledgeable than both you and I. And to this end, would you not be satisfied with the judgment, authority, and example of those who are the masters of the art of writing, the very ones from whom Petrarch and all other good writers have learned, and who should also have taught you to judge, had you read them, or read them well, or interpreted them soundly?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is no direct knowledge of Petrarch\u2019s intention.</p> </li> <li> <p>Castelvetro is not a reliable interpreter of Petrarch\u2019s mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although Petrarch did not use the words, it\u2019s impossible to determine whether he would have used them without reliable or direct knowledge of his intentions, which is unavailable.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is not possible to know whether Petrarch would have used those words.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other authors of his time used those words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Petrarch is an authority in Italian literature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other authors have authority as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although Petrarch did not use those words, the authority of other influential authors in Italian literature legitimizes their use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Those words can be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] But first one must understand the reason why Petrarch, according to you, would not use them. Because they are Latin? Is it then not licit for writers of one language to make use of the words of another? Or do you not know that they are permitted not only to use those that are foreign and common in the country, as these are; but also to admit those that have never before been written? and the new and the newly invented and the Greek and the barbarous ones, and those twisted from their original form and from their proper meaning at times? and not only the words, but also the figures of speech, transferring them from one language to another, against the rules and against common usage? And who says so? Castelvetro, perhaps? It is said by all the good authors of the Greek and Latin languages, and by some of our own who write about the art, and it has been put into practice by all those who have written artfully up to now. [\u2026]</p> <ul> <li> <p>Greek and Latin masters of rhetoric endorse the literary use of foreign words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Latin words are foreign, yet intelligible, in Italian.</p> </li> <li> <p>Italian is a literary language whose norms can be guided by classical precedent.</p> </li> <li> <p>If authoritative literary figures legitimize a rhetorical practice, and that practice is relevantly similar in a new context, then that practice is also legitimate in the new context.</p> </li> <li> <p>Italian authors are justified in using Latinisms.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Italian authors are justified in using Latinisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Those words are Latinisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>If Italian authors are justified in using Latinisms, as those words are, then Italian authors are justified in using those words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Those words can be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] Wouldn\u2019t a man be mad who, wishing to learn how to walk from another, always followed behind him, placing his feet precisely where the other had just lifted his? That is the same kind of madness you speak of, in wanting to make the same steps, and not the same walk, as Petrarch. To imitate him means to carry oneself and move one\u2019s legs as he did, not to place one\u2019s feet in his very footprints. He made judicious use, in all languages, of all worthy words; with the same judgment, anyone may likewise make use of them. What must be taken care of is not to do so without proper consideration. And in this respect, our language owes perpetual gratitude to Bembo, for he taught us how to proceed in this way, and restrained the boldness of those who transgressed too licentiously in this matter. [\u2026]</p> <ul> <li> <p>Learning involves emulating principles, not mimicking results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Literary imitation is a kind of learning.</p> </li> <li> <p>If learning in a domain requires emulating the method rather than the outcome, then learning in an analogous domain also requires the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>Literary imitation should emulate the author\u2019s judgment, not reproduce their words.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] But let us even suppose that Petrarch did not want to make use of these words because he did not like them. [\u2026] But how can you expect an author, no matter how much he writes, to put into use every single word of his era, without leaving behind many others that are just as excellent? That writers after him should be deprived both of the words he left aside and of those that had not yet come into use in his time? Beyond this, that Petrarch has taken away from others what he himself did? That an entire language should reside in a single author? That one alone should judge it? bring it to completion? This is to hold in matters of language the very same belief one holds in matters of faith: to claim that vernacular Italian should be confined to Petrarch and Boccaccio, just as to claim that sacred Scripture is wholly contained in the Gospels and Saint Paul. [\u2026]</p> <ul> <li> <p>To limit authors\u2019 ability to interpret and develop the language by binding it to past usage is akin to denying the contemporary Church its role in interpreting and expanding upon sacred Scripture.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Church holds the autority to interpret and expand upon sacred Scripture.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since denying authors interpretive authority over language is like denying the Church such authority over Scripture, and the Church has it, authors should have it too.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contemporary authors have the freedom to interpret and develop the language.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] I grant that the perfection of style\u2014though never fully realized in practice\u2014has, up to now, been found in our language particularly in Petrarch and Boccaccio. But for this, I do not wish to destroy the nature of the language itself, denying it the ability, like all others, to grow and decline. I do not wish to strip away entirely the judgment of those who have come after them and those who will come in the future. Nor do I wish to be deprived of the freedom they themselves enjoyed, as did all writers in every language. [\u2026] For here lies the error you have fallen into: believing that in this language one ought to act as in Greek and Latin\u2014languages which, being dead as regards common speech, must necessarily be written by drawing from the writings of the few and by imitating the best, since we cannot ourselves grasp their native power or beauty.

[\u2026]</p> <p>As for Quintilian, in saying that Horace is \u00abet varius figuris et verbis felicissime audax\u00bb [versatile in his Figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words] he means his daring as fortunate only within the bounds of the Latin language, as far as vocabulary is concerned; and in saying </p> <p>nisi quod iniqui iudices adversus nos sumus, ideoque paupertate sermonis laboramus </p> <p>except that we are unreasonable critics of ourselves, and consequently suffer from poverty of language</p> <p>he refers to the formation of Latin words after the model of Greek ones, and not to the importing of foreign words [\u2026] into another language, as Caro appears to assume; and in saying in two places \u00abaudendum\u00bb [one must dare], he does not mean it universally of words from every kind of foreign language, but specifically of words newly coined by the speaker following the manner of a foreign [\u2026] tongue. [\u2026]</p> <p>Now, just because, according to Varro, the role of the speaker and that of the poet are not the same in the use of analogy or proportion in words; nor because they are governed by different principles; nor because the poet is allowed to \u00abtransilire lineas impune\u00bb, or pass the mark, which Varro himself interprets to mean that the poet may follow analogy in words more freely than the speaker can; it does not follow, as Caro assumes, that one should therefore grant the poet the license to mix foreign words [\u2026] into his poem, just as it does not follow in the case of Horace because he calls usage the begetter of words, or because he says that many words now dead will be reborn, and many that are esteemed will fall into this condition </p> <p>si volet usus</p> <p>quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi</p> <p>if Usage so will it,</p> <p>in whose hands lies the judgement, the right and the rule of speech</p> <p>as Caro presupposes that one should grant. The power of usage is indeed great in generating new words, in reviving the dead, and in bringing down those that are honored, as Horace says, but it is slight or null when it comes to producing artificial words either by signification or by formation, which are the ones under discussion in those Horatian lines </p> <p>Licuit semperque licebit</p> <p>signatum pr\u00e6sente nota producere nomen</p> <p>It has ever been, and ever will be,</p> <p>permitted to issue words stamped with the mint-mark of the day</p> <p>as all this liberty in coining words depends entirely on the ingenious daring of the writer, and not on the force of prevailing usage, which Caro mistakenly believes. [\u2026]</p> <p>What remains is to see whether, by coming close to the opinion of Messer Pietro Bembo, who alone has discoursed on such words, and to the example of Italian poets, we may uphold them with merit in the canzone where they were placed by Caro.</p> <p>But in order to fully understand the opinion of so venerable a writer on this matter, and to know with certainty where and when the use of Latin words in a canzone is permitted after the example of Italian poets, I say first that one must select certain authoritative writers to trust regarding the choice of words; or rather, one should acknowledge those that Messer Pietro Bembo has already selected, named in his books on the Italian language and cited in confirmation of the things he teaches us. Among them, he judges Boccaccio to be the finest prose writer, Petrarch the finest poet, and both the most recent in time to be worthy of consideration.</p> <p>Now Caro should not be surprised if, since he himself says that our language owes much to the doctrine of Bembo in the choice of words, I refrain from placing much trust in this regard in Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, in Angelo Poliziano, or in any other more recent author, since I do so on the advice of Bembo himself, whom Caro has approved as a sound counsellor. [\u2026]</p> <p>Volumes, then, disavowed by their authors, however worthy, left to us incomplete, freely criticized by Bembo with regard to their language, or passed over by him in silence, cannot shield us from reproach if we fill our writings with their words, unless those words are also found in other volumes that lack neither final revision, nor the satisfaction of their author, nor the approval of Bembo.</p> <p>Nonetheless, beyond the aforementioned completeness of the volumes, the satisfaction of their authors, and the approval of Bembo, it is the advice of Quintilian, in this matter of using Latin or other such words after the example of others, that one should carefully consider, so as not to err in using words which noble authors have placed in their volumes, not so much whether such authors happened to use those particular words, as whether they brought others to share their judgment and gained followers in this regard.</p> <p>But whether Petrarch\u2019s not having used these words [\u2026] should be believed to have proceeded from judgment\u2014that is, because he did not deem them worthy of his writings\u2014or from some other circumstance, such as the brevity of his life, or the narrowness or simplicity of his subject matter, as though we ought to think [\u2026] that, had he written longer or on other subjects, he would have used other modes of expression and other words; and, just as Caro likewise affirms, [\u2026] we may almost say that Petrarch lived a short life, though he passed seventy full years less one day for the most part in good health, comfort, and repose, and occupied with nothing other than the pleasing studies of poetry; and composed few sonnets and canzoni on no diverse subject, although he wrote more extensively and with greater variety in this form of verse than did any other who lived before him, or with him, or after him. But, as I say, whether this is to be considered the result of deliberate judgment or of some other cause, it is not necessary at present to say more of it. [\u2026]</p> <p>From the works written in rhyme by Petrarch in such quantity and over so long a life, it may, I say, most clearly be discerned and safely affirmed which words Petrarch would have used and which he would not, had he lived longer than he did, or had he written more extensively or on other subjects than he did. Nor is he who claims to discern this, in my opinion, bound to produce a warrant granted by Petrarch declaring his will and what he would or would not have done in this matter, for greater certainty of another\u2019s unexpressed will, and of what he intended to do or not to do, cannot be had than from the tenor of his other like actions previously preserved by him. Nor, likewise, is he bound to confess that the spirit or soul of Petrarch passed into his body according to Pythagorean or Kabbalistic metempsychosis, or to boast of having had such knowledge by divine inspiration or revelation, as Caro says, jesting at my words \u00abPetrarch would not use\u00bb, that I am bound to do, since I claim to discern it. But without producing any warrant, or confessing the passage of soul or spirit into a new body, or boasting of divine inspiration or revelation, Caro may yet believe me, since, according to his own words, I am well-versed in the vocabulary; and he, who is not so well-versed in it, is mistaken in denying that in Petrarch are to be found the words \u201cfamelico\u201d, \u201ceternare\u201d, \u201clentare\u201d, because in the vocabulary of my memory \u201cfamelico\u201d is recorded as said by Petrarch in the verse [\u2026]</p> <p>If, then, I did not mark the Latin words in Caro\u2019s canzone merely because Petrarch had not used them, but for other reasons, as clearly appears from what has been said, and was evident even before, it is unjust of him to accuse me of wishing to confine the entire vernacular Italian within the limits set by Petrarch and Boccaccio. And it is belated of him to repeat to me three times, as if it were some great and beautiful secret, unheard of by one of my station, that a living language such as our vernacular, which is still spoken and thus still alive, is not formed for our writing entirely from books, and much less from a single book, as happens with those languages no longer spoken and now dead, except insofar as they live in the books of their authors, such as Latin and Greek. Rather, it is formed in large part also from the usage of many who speak it, as though the Latin words I marked were currently spoken. Now, in saying this, does he not perceive, or does he pretend not to perceive, that he is contradicting Messer Pietro Bembo, who advises us to write not with the words of the people or of the present age, in whole or in part, but with those of the ancient authors and of their time, in Italian as in any other language, whenever the words of past authors and of past times are better than those of the people or of our present age? Such, according to him, are the words used by Boccaccio and Petrarch and by their century, which he holds to be superior to those that we use today. [\u2026]</p> <p>Moreover, it is unjust that he should be surprised by my judgment, falsely accusing me of thinking that one must necessarily draw the entire language in which we write from the writings of a single author, against the teaching of Quintilian: </p> <p>Sed non qui maxime imitandus, et solus imitandus est </p> <p>The author who is most to be imitated is not also the only author to be imitated</p> <p>falsely attributing to him\u2014whether out of ignorance or of malice\u2014the intention to speak in that remark of the likeness of words, whereas in fact he speaks of the likeness of the other virtues of the speaker, as one will clearly see if they look carefully at that passage. But without attributing to him what he does not believe, I may well be surprised at him, who, in order to turn others against me, also goes so far as to say that proposing Boccaccio and Petrarch as the sole model for writing\u2014supposing that I do indeed propose them as such with regard to language\u2014is nothing else than reducing the whole of the Christian religion to the New Testament, refusing to accept the traditions of the Fathers. These, he says, ought to have a place no less in vernacular Italian than in Christianity, failing to recognize the great difference between the traditions of the holy Christian Fathers and the traditions of his peers, whom he intends to propose to us as Fathers in this language. For whereas the former reveal the glory of the Gospel, restrain the license of dissolute worldly living, and mortify the flesh to give life to the spirit, the latter obscure the clarity of the language, loosen all discipline of measured speech, and exalt and defend ignorance in order to cast down and confound knowledge.</p>"}, {"location": "examples/#Ragione", "title": "Ragione d\u2019alcune cose segnate nella Canzone d\u2019Annibal Caro", "text": "<p>Venite a\u2019 l\u2019ombra de\u2019 gran gigli d\u2019oro</p>"}, {"location": "examples/#falli-di-parole", "title": "Falli di parole", "text": "<p>Lodovico Castelvetro</p>"}, {"location": "examples/#mala-elezione-di-parole-forestiere", "title": "Mala elezione di parole forestiere", "text": "<p>[\u2026] Poich\u00e9 le parole latine sono straniere a\u2019 vulgari, [\u2026] s\u00ec come non acconcie ad essere adoperate in questa canzone sono state da me segnate, e vanamente si producono dal Caro per sostegno loro l\u2019autorit\u00e0 de\u2019 valenti maestri di ritorica e di poesia, alcuni de\u2019 quali non parlano di questa maniera di parole strane e alcuni ne parlano s\u00ec, ma niegano l\u2019uso loro o non lo concedono in questo caso; s\u00ec come ancora s\u2019adducono certi essempi di scrittori e alcune ragioni che non appertengono alla disputa nostra.

Cognitive linguistics argues that such perspectivisation process underlies the production of meaning and entails authorial responsibility in discourse: a viewpoint is the cognitive mechanism by which a speaker (or conceptualizer) construes an event or situation <sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>At the core of cognitive perspectivisation is the subject actively construing a perceived, evaluated, negated, or inferred situation. Because this process is inherently subjective, the same occurrence can be conceptualized in multiple, sometimes conflicting ways. This contrastive dimension becomes especially salient in argumentative contexts.</p> <p>We therefore treat argumentation as a special case of perspectivisation, subject to additional logical constraints. Achieving compatibility between the two models is significant not only because their key elements can be mapped to one another, but also because each model deepens the relationships among them with complementary focuses.</p> <p>Perspectivisation theory accounts for the persistence of an agent\u2019s internal point of view in their conception of external facts through a mechanism of compositionality. It focuses on the interaction between an occurrence and the agent\u2019s lens, which are blended in the concept the agent forms of the situation, shaping the meaning conveyed in discourse.</p> <p>Argumentation theory, by contrast, offers a finer account of how an agent accesses their preconceptions, which serve as tools for both interpreting and expressing a fact. It explicitly distinguishes the core components of argumentation (premises, inference rule, conclusion) from the factors that enable argument production (dialogical agent, acceptance attitude, knowledge base), grouping these within an intermediate structure (the agent\u2019s internal argumentation theory). This model clarifies an aspect absent in perspectivisation: the relation between background and lens, that is, between the knowledge base and the premises and inference rules derivable from it. It leaves out, however, how the opinion on the topic expressed in the conclusion comes to form a new blended entity, merely making it available as support for further argumentation. Finally, argumentation theory qualifies the nature of contrast, extending it beyond conflicts between conclusions to allow for oppositions in which a conclusion targets the support (premise or inference rule) of another argument.</p>"}, {"location": "model/#methodology", "title": "Methodology", "text": "<p>Building an ontology is complex, as its value depends on the context it supports.

Additionally, components were integrated from established ontologies, namely DOLCE.</p> <p>DOLCE serves a dual role within the ontology. First, its Eventuality and Agent classes provide ontological entry points for grounding discourse entities in real-world referents. Second, its Descriptions and Situations framework (DnS) offers a structural basis for modeling perspectivisation and argumentative configurations as situation descriptions. This layer of abstraction enables compatibility with a range of domain ontologies, supporting flexible integration.</p> <p>In DnS, binary relations are usually modeled as roles and n-ary relations as situations satisfying descriptions. We assigned roles to the entities outside the scope of our domain: for example, an eventuality may function as the topic of a perspective, while an agent will act as a dialogical agent within an argumentative exchange. On the other hand, descriptions capture the formal structure of the configuration, that is, the theoretical model of how components such as premises, conclusions, and agents relate within a given argumentative situation.</p> <p>Because we model n-ary relations, relying on domain and range constraints alone to define class membership would be inadequate. Argumentative situations require the presence of multiple essential components to be semantically well-formed.

Therefore, class-level equivalence axioms, and not the properties themselves, are the primary mechanism for type recognition in the ontology.</p> <p>The resulting Argumentation and Perspectivisation modules are self-contained and usable independently.

During this time, we imagine him\u2014despite professed indifference and within the narrow margins left by his official duties\u2014engaged in the careful orchestration of his polemical and literary campaign, seeking the advice of his circle and especially his friend Benedetto Varchi. \u201cI feel like the man who tried to build a house in the town square but couldn\u2019t finish it because of the sheer number of architects,\u201d he wrote to Varchi, explaining his decision to go to print despite conflicting advice: some urging caution, others warning that softening the polemical tone would spoil the effect.</p> Title page of Caro\u2019s Apologia. The specially-made device depicts a serpentine matchlock mechanism, crowned with the words vim vi, a shorthand for the maxim \u201cvim vi repellere licet\u201d (\u201cIt is permitted to repel force with force\u201d), and framed by four satyr heads. <p>By the time of publication, the Farnese had shifted to the imperial side and the encomiastic themes of the Canzone seemed inevitably dated. Nevertheless, the Apologia stands as a masterpiece of spite, blending deforming irony, pointed argumentation, rhetorical crescendos, and menacing overtones. It draws on the burlesco style Caro had cultivated in his early Florentine poetry, in the manner of Francesco Berni, before turning to more \u201cserious\u201d literary forms.</p> <p>The work mocks Castelvetro starting with its very structure: a sequence of contributions attributed to a ludicrous cast of fictitious Roman academics, all introduced by Mastro Pasquino\u2014the academy\u2019s janitor, who proclaims himself Castelvetro\u2019s accomplice in slander. Each voice takes on a distinct stylistic function: Predella delivers a point-by-point rebuttal of Castelvetro\u2019s critique; Buratto unleashes a caustic invective; and Ser Fedocco recounts an allegorical dream in which the adversary is represented as a barn owl, a caricature of the owl Castelvetro had adopted as his emblem, dwelling in a glass castle, a pun on his name, clear on the outside but foul within. The castle had appeared up in the air, disrupting the peace of Parnassus, and is demolished by order of Apollo. From the rubble, the owl is dragged in mock triumph, crowned with nettle, tried before a dwarfish embodiment of the very words Castelvetro had condemned in the Canzone, and ultimately subjected to a grotesque crucifixion.</p> <p> </p> <p>An excerpt from the outspoken index of the Apologia.</p> <p>Although the Apologia deploys a range of rhetorical strategies, Predella\u2019s contribution merits closer attention for the substance of its literary arguments. Caro reaffirms his Petrarchist allegiance, even as he slips its constraints: poetic rules and models must yield to the creative freedom of the poet and to the evolution of a living language, against the treatment of poetry as a dead language or a mathematical calculus.</p>"}, {"location": "scenario/#the-ragione", "title": "The Ragione", "text": "<p>Castelvetro was evidently champing at the bit for the Apologia\u2019s appearance\u2014so much so that, according to Varchi\u2019s Ercolano, he offered to cover the cost of publication himself\u2014and produced his rebuttal in a mere forty-five days. With the Ragione, Castelvetro seizes the opportunity to display the full extent of his erudition: it is a treatise on language and poetic style that, while responding point-by-point to the Apologia, stands as an autonomous work.</p> Title page of Castelvetro\u2019s Ragione. The author is identified by his device, which depicts the owl of Athena perched on top of a toppled urn, revealed to be empty, with the Greek inscriptio kekrika (\u201cI have judged\u201d). <p>Castelvetro opens the Ragione by outlining an ideal poetic language, against which Caro\u2019s Canzone dei Gigli is assessed for both \u201cword faults\u201d and \u201cfeeling faults.\u201d The confrontation revives the ancient debate between anomalists and analogists: Caro advocated for a poetic language close to speech, while Castelvetro, accused in the Apologia of reducing the Italian vernacular to a rarefied lexicon drawn from Petrarch and Boccaccio, counters with a more rigorous conception of imitation.</p> <p>Drawing on Quintilian, he maintains that imitation is first ethical, then linguistic: no single author suffices as a model, and word usage must be validated by its survival in later authors. For Castelvetro, the authority of literary tradition defines the limits of poetic license. Innovation in vocabulary must be sparing, motivated by poetic quality, and intelligible to the audience. He dissects Caro\u2019s lexical choices on philological and historical-linguistic grounds: Latinisms, trivial etymologies, attestation in works of little value, or the availability of better alternatives all constitute faults. Etymology, alongside grammar and rhetoric, becomes a tool for deeper critical inquiry, underpinned by the belief in the systematic nature of language.</p> <p>His treatment of metaphor follows Aristotelian principles: metaphors must serve knowledge, a criterion Caro fails to meet. He also criticizes the Canzone for blurring the line between metaphor and allegory, lacking the formal discipline to prevent one figure from collapsing into the other.</p> <p>Finally, responding to Caro\u2019s charge of malice, Castelvetro reaffirms the critic\u2019s right and duty to evaluate public works, framing critique as a necessary condition of poetic discourse.</p>"}, {"location": "scenario/#legacy", "title": "Legacy", "text": "<p>By the mid-1550s, the controversy had shifted from the literary to the political level, with mounting personal consequences for Castelvetro. In 1555, he was accused of orchestrating the murder of Alberigo Longo, a poet aligned with Caro and one of the authors behind the circulating parodic verses against Castelvetro, though he consistently denied involvement. At the same time, his pseudonymous translation of a work by Melanchthon drew the Inquisition\u2019s suspicion of Reformed sympathies. Caro, both in the Apologia and through his network of influence in Rome, played an active role in amplifying those charges.</p> <p>Castelvetro\u2019s heresy trial became the object of a jurisdictional dispute between the Duchy of Ferrara and the Papacy, but he was ultimately excommunicated in absentia. In 1560, he traveled to Rome to appeal the decision, but fled to Chiavenna, then part of the Swiss Confederacy, once it became clear the outcome would not change. There, he began work on a Correzione of Varchi\u2019s Ercolano, who by 1561 had taken the place of Caro in the controversy. Death prevented him from completing it, but the work was published posthumously in Basel in 1572 by his brother, Giovanni Maria Castelvetro.</p> <p>The controversy left a lasting legacy, periodically reemerging as a touchstone for cultural tensions\u2014between Classicism and Baroque, Enlightenment and Romanticism.  As late as the 18th century, Ludovico Antonio Muratori and Giusto Fontanini reignited the debate, aligning with Castelvetro and Caro, respectively.</p> <p>At stake was not merely a question of poetic taste, but a deeper redefinition of intellectual identity that the confrontation helped crystallize. For Castelvetro, Petrarchism was adherence to the thing through the word: terse, truthful, and grounded in the study, excavation, and contemplation of the classics. Caro, by contrast, embraced a Petrarchism that revived Petrarch\u2019s imagery but not his linguistic or textual discipline: a source of artifice and allegory, and, in essence, pre-Baroque. Each came to embody a new model of intellectual: Caro, the court poet empowered by his profession; Castelvetro, the niche specialist legitimized by erudition\u2014both ultimately removed from the humanist ideal of the intellectual as philosopher shaping discourse through ideas and values.</p> <p>Castelvetro knew how to reason, and by reasoning he would crush whatever stood before him. But Caro knew how to write, and by writing he could, through the enchantment of style, replace the real image with a caricatured and grotesque puppet of his opponent and set it up in the public square for ridicule.</p> <p>Carlo Dionisotti, Annibal Caro e il Rinascimento, p. 35 (translation is ours)</p> <p>A small sample of the texts, both original and translated, can be read in Examples.

The debate proceeds through appeals to authority, reductio ad absurdum, irony, ad personam and composite arguments, implicit premises, concessions, and distinctions\u2014rationales that are difficult to extract without analytical decomposition. It requires clarification of the dialectical architecture underlying rhetorical and literary discourse: identifying the loci of disagreement, tracing the movement of claims across voices and genres, and exposing the justificatory principles at play, including those grounded in ipse dixit rather than formal inference. As such, the scenario functions not only as a historical case study but also as a stress test for the ontology\u2019s capacity to capture perspectival conflict and the rhetorical reconfiguration of meaning.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A.
