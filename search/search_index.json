The most skeptical in this regard was Stephen Toulmin, who in 1958 introduced a model of argument consisting of three core elements: the claim, the grounds (evidence supporting the claim), and the warrant (the principle explaining why the grounds support the claim). The model also included optional components such as backing (support for the warrant), rebuttal (conditions under which the claim might not hold), and qualifier (indicating the strength of the claim).</p> <p>This is exemplified in Toulmin\u2019s well-known case:</p> <p>Claim: Harry is a British subject.</p> <p>Grounds: Harry was born in Bermuda.</p> <p>Warrant: A man born in Bermuda will generally be a British subject.</p> <p>Backing: Statute and case law covering nationality.</p> <p>Qualifier: Presumably.</p> <p>Rebuttal: Unless his parents were foreign diplomats, or he has renounced his nationality.</p> <p>Toulmin\u2019s emphasis on warrants and backing drew directly from the structure of legal reasoning, where the strength of an argument rests not on its formal validity but on its grounding in the accepted procedures and norms of justification within a particular field. In this way, his model emphasized that reasoning varies across disciplines, depends on context, and must be judged by practical standards, laying the groundwork for a pragmatic and normative theory of argumentation.</p> <p>Building on this approach, Douglas Walton extended the analysis of context-sensitive reasoning through a systematic catalog of argumentation schemes\u2014structured templates for common types of arguments. Each scheme includes typical premises and conclusions, along with critical questions designed to test the argument\u2019s strength and uncover hidden assumptions. For example, the appeal to expert opinion scheme can be represented as:</p> <p>E is an expert in domain D.</p> <p>E asserts that proposition P is true.</p> <p>P is within D.</p> <p>Therefore, P is true.</p> <p>To evaluate this argument, one may ask: How credible is E a source? Is E truly an expert in domain D? What exactly did E assert that implies P? Is E personally reliable? Is P consistent with what other experts assert? Is E\u2019s assertion of P based on evidence?</p> <p>Walton regarded argument schemes as dialogical devices: each argument is a move in a dialogue, and the scheme it instantiates defines the set of appropriate responses (counterarguments) to that move. Schemes such as the appeal to expert opinion model source-based reasoning, and thereby offer a casuistic refinement of Toulmin\u2019s notion of backing for warrants.</p> <pre><code>---\nconfig:\n  fontFamily: var(--md-text-font-family)\n  themeCSS: \".main text { fill: var(--md-default-fg-color) } .title text { font-weight: 700; } .labels text { font-weight: 300; } .border line { stroke: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter); }\"\n  quadrantChart:\n    chartWidth: 450\n    chartHeight: 450\n    pointTextPadding: 0\n    pointRadius: 0\n    titleFontSize: 16\n    pointLabelFontSize: 16\n  themeVariables:\n    quadrantInternalBorderStrokeFill: var(--md-default-fg-color--lighter)\n    quadrantExternalBorderStrokeFill: none\n    quadrant1Fill: none\n    quadrant2Fill: none\n    quadrant3Fill: none\n    quadrant4Fill: none\n---\nquadrantChart\n    title Argumentation Theories by Formality and Normativity\n    x-axis Descriptive --&gt; Prescriptive\n    y-axis Pragmatic --&gt; Abstract\n    Phan Minh Dung: [0.35, 0.95]\n    John Pollock: [0.15, 0.75]\n    Douglas Walton: [0.45, 0.4]\n    Frans van Eemeren: [0.82, 0.25]\n    Stephen Toulmin: [0.6, 0.1]</code></pre>"}, {"location": "background/#pollocks-attacks", "title": "Pollock\u2019s attacks", "text": "<p>In the mid-1980s, John Pollock played a central role in applying defeasible reasoning to argumentation, addressing the limitations that made classical deductive logic unsuitable for representing real-world reasoning. In practice, argumentation follows the principles of non-monotonic logic, where the addition of new information, describing a more particular case, can invalidate previously valid conclusions.</p> <p>One of Pollock\u2019s key examples illustrates this:</p> <p>The object looks red.</p> <p>Therefore, the object is red.</p> <p>But the object is illuminated by a red light.</p> <p>So, it is not the case that the object would look red only if it were red.</p> <p>In this case, the object appears red and is therefore presumed to be red until it is discovered that it is illuminated by a red light. The object may still be red, but it can no longer be concluded solely from its appearance. This kind of situation cannot be represented within classical deductive logic, where valid inferences are monotonic: if a conclusion follows from a premise, it continues to follow regardless of the addition of new premises. If A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true\u2014no further information (C) can defeat B. But in everyday reasoning, conclusions are often provisional: they hold until new, relevant information defeats them. This is the core insight motivating non-monotonic logics and their application to argumentation.</p> <p>Pollock formalized defeasible reasoning by distinguishing two kinds of attacks on arguments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Undercut, such as the red-light case, which challenges the connection between premise and conclusion without offering an alternative conclusion (under those conditions, one cannot know what color the object really is).</p> </li> <li> <p>Rebuttal, or distinction, which accepts the validity of the inference A \u2192 B but introduces a new premise C that leads to conclude that the case under consideration is a special case, an exception, and therefore to reach the opposite conclusion: A \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A canonical example of the latter is the Tweety case, first introduced by Raymond Reiter in 1980:</p> <p>Tweety is a bird.</p> <p>Birds typically fly.</p> <p>Therefore, Tweety flies.</p> <p>But Tweety is a penguin.</p> <p>Penguins don\u2019t fly.</p> <p>So Tweety doesn\u2019t fly.</p> <p>Here, the initial generalization is rebutted by a specific exception. Notice also that in this case the premise Tweety is a bird is not only conceded but implicitly reaffirmed by the added information that Tweety is a penguin. This shows how deductive and defeasible reasoning can coexist within a single discourse: while the inference Tweety is a penguin \u2192 Tweety is a bird is deductively valid, the defeasible rule Birds fly is overridden by a more specific case.</p> <p>Pollock\u2019s system did not allow attacks on premises, but later formalisations recognized the need for a third type of attack to account for plausible reasoning. This attack, now known as undermining, negates an argument\u2019s non-axiomatic premise and removes the support for its conclusion. Unlike undercuts, it does not invalidate the inference itself, but the conclusion remains unsupported unless the premise is defended. Undermining is currently being investigated in the context of belief revision, as it reduces the informational base from which agents draw further inferences.</p> Three Types of Attack A B C UndercutC \u2192 \u00ac(A \u2192 B) A B C \u00acB RebuttalA \u2227 C \u2192 \u00acB A B \u00acA C UnderminingC \u2192 \u00acA"}, {"location": "background/#dungs-abstract-argumentation", "title": "Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation", "text": "<p>In 1995, Phan Minh Dung introduced an abstract formalism for argumentation that separated the acceptability of arguments from both their internal structure and the specific nature of their conflicts. In his model, arguments are nodes in a directed graph connected by binary attack relations. A calculus of opposition is then applied to determine sets of acceptable arguments, called extensions, that represent rational stances if they are internally coherent (conflict-free) and externally defended. These extensions depend solely on attack and defense: a defense occurs when an argument in the set attacks an attacker of another member. The arguments of such an admissible extension are labelled as accepted, those attacked by an argument of the extension are defeated, and the others are undefined.</p> <p>This set-theoretic approach decoupled abstract from structured argumentation, revolutionizing the field and enabling further mathematical development.

Argument A structure built from a set of premises, a conclusion, and a strict or defeasible inference rule connecting them. An argument is built on the basis of a knowledge base within a given argumentation system. Attack A relation between two arguments where the conclusion of one contradicts a premise, the conclusion, or the inference rule in the other. These are called undermining, rebutting, and undercutting attacks, respectively. <p>ASPIC<sup>+</sup> arguments generate abstract argumentation frameworks, to which Dung-like extension calculus can be applied to evaluate acceptability. Importantly, ASPIC<sup>+</sup> is not a specific argumentation system, but a general framework for specifying such systems.

But since some of these elements are concisely expressed\u2014having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity\u2014and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent\u2019s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.</p> <p>First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that Petrarch would not use the words \u00abcede\u00bb, \u00abinviolata\u00bb, \u00abpropizia\u00bb, \u00abgesti\u00bb, \u00abinserte\u00bb, \u00abamene\u00bb, \u00absimulacri\u00bb, or \u00abillustri\u00bb outside of rhyme\u2014not because these words were unheard of, since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, that led him to set them aside. Nor, similarly, would he use \u00abambo\u00bb when referring to two feminine referents without the explicit\u2014and not implied\u2014accompaniment of a noun. Nor would he use \u00abancor essa\u00bb, since refined usage of the language does not admit \u00abesso\u00bb with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well.) But one cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora\u00bb. (Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well.) Consequently, one also cannot say: \u00abIl Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro ne fa ancor esso\u00bb. Nor could one say \u00abmadre ancor essa\u00bb.</p> <p>Nor would he use \u00absuo merto e tuo valore\u00bb without \u00abper\u00bb, since, as far as I recall from my readings, the omission of \u00abper\u00bb occurs only before three nouns: \u00abtempo\u00bb, \u00abgrazia\u00bb, and \u00abmerc\u00e9\u00bb or \u00abmercede\u00bb, as in: \u00abE di notte tempo, con iscale ed altri ingegni, entr\u00f2 nella citt\u00e0 di Cortona\u00bb. (And by night-time, with ladders and other devices, he entered the city of Cortona.) [\u2026] Nor would he use \u00abtarpato\u00bb, as it is a plebeian word, never perhaps accepted in any writings except those of Angelo Poliziano.

[\u2026] If you were to say that Petrarch had not used them, one might believe you, for you are well-versed in vocabulary. But in saying outright that \u00abhe would not use them\u00bb, one must consider whether you have reliable authority on the matter, and what exactly you know of it; whether, by chance, as you so freely dispense the name and wisdom of Petrarch, his very spirit has entered your body. For in that case\u2014or if you had it by revelation, or by some other demonstration, provided it did not come from your own mind\u2014I am content to accept what you say; and Caro will admit he used them poorly, since he holds Petrarch as the prince of poets in our language, worthy of reverence and admiration above all others. But if it is merely something you say and imagine on your own, I am under no obligation to believe it, and your imagination carries no weight.\u2014 Nor should one believe you either \u2014 you will say. Very well: on this, we are in agreement. It remains that we must agree to refer the matter (as is necessary) to third parties more knowledgeable than both you and I. And to this end, would you not be satisfied with the judgment, authority, and example of those who are the masters of the art of writing\u2014the very ones from whom Petrarch and all other good writers have learned, and who should also have taught you to judge, had you read them, or read them well, or interpreted them soundly?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is not possible to know whether Petrarch would have used those words merely because he did not happen to use them.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Petrarch never used certain words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other authors of his time used those words.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although Petrarch did not use those words, the authority of other influential authors in Italian literature legitimizes their use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Those words can be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>[\u2026] But how can you expect an author, no matter how much he writes, to put into use every single word of his era, without leaving behind many others that are just as excellent? That writers after him should be deprived both of the words he left aside and of those that had not yet come into use in his time? Beyond this, that Petrarch has taken away from others what he himself did? That an entire language should reside in a single author? That one alone should judge it? bring it to completion? This is to hold in matters of language the very same belief one holds in matters of faith: to claim that vernacular Italian should be confined to Petrarch and Boccaccio, just as to claim that sacred Scripture is wholly contained in the Gospels and Saint Paul. [\u2026] I grant that the perfection of style\u2014though never fully realized in practice\u2014has, up to now, been found in our language particularly in Petrarch and Boccaccio. But for this, I do not wish to destroy the nature of the language itself, denying it the ability, like all others, to grow and decline. I do not wish to strip away entirely the judgment of those who have come after them and those who will come in the future.

To this end, we chose as our reference scenario a major literary controversy from the Italian Renaissance: the dispute between the Modenese critic Lodovico Castelvetro and the Marchigiano poet Annibal Caro.

Bembo advocated for Petrarch and Boccaccio as respective models for poetry and prose.</p> <p>In 1553, Annibal Caro composed a Canzone dei Gigli d\u2019oro in Petrarchist style, commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese to commemorate his family\u2019s alliance with the Valois of France. Despite its modest literary quality, the poem received clamor of praise among Roman intellectuals. Perplexed by this acclaim, the Modenese jurist Aurelio Bellincini sent the text to his friend Lodovico Castelvetro for evaluation. Castelvetro, long engaged in a commentary on Petrarch\u2019s Canzoniere, dismissed the poem with a succint, seventeen-point note criticizing its inapt vocabulary and feeble metaphors.</p> <p>Although Castelvetro had expressed a desire for his views to remain private\u2014how sincerely is unclear\u2014the note nonetheless circulated at the Roman court and in other Italian cities, threatening to discredit Caro: his position as secretary to the Farnese, secured by his literary reputation despite his modest origins, depended entirely on his patrons\u2019 favor.</p> <p>Caro promptly began to prepare a defensive strategy, mobilizing influential supporters to direct harsh criticism at Castelvetro. In 1554, the Canzone appeared in print as an appendix to a collection of letters by illustrious men edited by Lodovico Dolce, accompanied by a commentary attributed to Caro and almost certainly his own work, though he always refuted its authorship.

The castle had appeared up in the air, disrupting the peace of Parnassus, and is demolished by order of Apollo.

He dissects Caro\u2019s lexical choices on philological and historical-linguistic grounds: Latinisms, trivial etymologies, attestation in works of little value, or the availability of better alternatives all constitute faults.
