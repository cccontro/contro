I.  
    1.  Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro,
    2.  care muse, devote a’ miei giacinti:
    3.  e d’[ambo]{: #w2-en ana="#disputed-words" } insieme avinti
    4.  tessiam ghirlande a’ nostri idoli, e fregi.
    5.  E tu, signor, ch’io per mio sole adoro,
    6.  perché non sian dall’altro sole estinti,
    7.  del tuo nome dipinti,
    8.  gli sacra, ond’io lor porga eterni pregi:
    9.  ché por degna corona a tanti regi
    10.  per me non oso: e ’ndarno altri m’invita,
    11.  se l’ardire e l’aita
    12.  non vien da te. Tu sol m’apri e dispensi
    13.  Parnaso: e tu mi desta, e tu m’aviva
    14.  lo stil, la lingua e i sensi,
    15.  sì ch’altamente ne ragioni e scriva.

II.  
    1.  Giace, quasi gran conca, infra due mari
    2.  e due monti famosi, Alpe e Pirene,
    3.  parte delle più [amene]{: #w12-en ana="#disputed-words" }
    4.  d’Europa, e di quant’anco il sol circonda:
    5.  di tesori e di popoli e d’altari,
    6.  ch’al nostro vero nume erge e mantene,
    7.  di preziose vene,
    8.  d’arti e d’armi e d’amor madre feconda.
    9.  Novella Berecintia, a cui gioconda
    10.  [cede]{: #w1-en ana="#disputed-words" } l’altra il suo carro e i suoi leoni:
    11.  e sol par ch’incoroni
    12.  di tutte le sue torri Italia e lei:
    13.  e dica: — Ite, miei Galli, or Galli interi,
    14.  gli indi e i persi e i caldei
    15.  vincete, e fate un sol di tanti imperi. —

III.  
    1.  Di questa madre generosa e chiara,
    2.  madre [ancor essa]{: #w4-en ana="#disputed-words" } di celesti eroi,
    3.  regnano oggi fra noi
    4.  d’altri Giovi altri figli ed altre suore;
    5.  e vie più degni ancor d’incenso e d’ara,
    6.  che non fûr già, vecchio Saturno, i tuoi.
    7.  Ma ciascun gli onor suoi
    8.  ripon nell’umiltate e nel timore
    9.  del maggior Dio. Mirate al vincitore
    10.  d’Augusto invitto, al glorioso Errico,
    11.  come, di Cristo amico,
    12.  con la pietà, con l’onestà, con l’armi,
    13.  col sollevar gli oppressi e punir gli empi,
    14.  non coi bronzi o coi marmi,
    15.  si va sacrando i [simulacri]{: #w3-en ana="#disputed-words" } e i tempi.

IV.  
    1.  Mirate, come placido e severo
    2.  è di se stesso a sé legge e corona.
    3.  Vedete Iri e Bellona,
    4.  come dietro gli vanno, e Temi avanti
    5.  com’ha la ragion seco, e ’l senno e ’l vero:
    6.  bella schiera che mai non l’abbandona.
    7.  Udite come tuona
    8.  sopra de’ licaoni e de’ giganti.
    9.  Guardate quanti n’ha già domi, e quanti
    10.  ne percuote e n’accenna; e con che possa
    11.  scuote d’Olimpo e d’Ossa
    12.  gli svelti monti, e ’ncontro al ciel imposti.
    13.  Oh qual fia poi, spento Tifeo l’audace
    14.  e i folgori deposti!
    15.  quanta il mondo n’avrà letizia e pace!

V.  
    1.  La sua gran Giuno in tanta altezza umìle,
    2.  gode dell’amor suo, lieta e sicura;
    3.  e non è sdegno o cura
    4.  che ’l cor le punga, o di Calisto o d’Io.
    5.  [Suo merto e tuo valor]{: #w5-en ana="#disputed-words" }, donna gentile,
    6.  di nome e d’alma [inviolata]{: #w6-en ana="#disputed-words" } e pura.
    7.  E fu nostra ventura,
    8.  e providenza del superno Iddio,
    9.  ch’in sì gran regno, a sì gran re t’unio,
    10.  perché del suo splendore e del tuo seme
    11.  risorgesse la speme
    12.  della tua Flora e dell’Italia tutta.
    13.  Che se mai raggio suo ver’ lei si stende
    14.  (benché serva e distrutta),
    15.  ancor salute e libertà n’attende.

VI.  
    1.  Vera Minerva, e veramente nata
    2.  di Giove stesso e del suo senno è quella
    3.  ch’ora è figlia e sorella
    4.  di regi [illustri]{: #w9-en ana="#disputed-words" }, e ne fia madre e sposa.
    5.  Vergine, che di gloria incoronata,
    6.  quasi lunge dal sol [propizia]{: #w8-en ana="#disputed-words" } stella,
    7.  ti stai d’amor rubella,
    8.  per dar più luce a questa notte ombrosa.
    9.  Viva perla, serena e preziosa,
    10.  qual ha Febo di te cosa più degna?
    11.  per te vive, in te regna;
    12.  col tuo sfavilla il suo bel lume tanto
    13.  ch’ogni cor arde, e ’l mio ne sente un foco
    14.  tal, ch’io ne volo e canto
    15.  infra i tuoi cigni, e son [tarpato]{: #w7-en ana="#disputed-words" } e roco.

VII.  
    1.  Evvi ancor Cintia, e v’era Endimione:
    2.  coppia che sì felice oggi sarebbe,
    3.  se ’l fior che per lei crebbe,
    4.  oimè non l’era (e ’n su l’aprirsi) anciso!
    5.  Ma che, se legge a morte amore impone?
    6.  se spento, ha quel che (più vivendo) avrebbe?
    7.  se ’l morir non rincrebbe,
    8.  per viver sempre, e non da lei diviso?
    9.  Quante poi, dolci il core e liete il viso,
    10.  v’hanno Ciprigne e dive altre simìli?
    11.  quanti forti e gentili,
    12.  che si fan, bene oprando, al ciel la via?
    13.  e se pur non son dèi, qual altra gente
    14.  è che più degna sia
    15.  o di clava o di tirso o di tridente?

VIII.  
    1.  Canzon, se la virtù, se i chiari [gesti]{: #w10-en ana="#disputed-words" }
    2.  ne fan celesti, del ciel degne sono
    3.  l’alme di ch’io ragiono.
    4.  Tu lor queste di fiori umìli offerte
    5.  porgi in mia vece, e di’: — Se non son elle
    6.  d’oro e di gemme [inserte]{: #w11-en ana="#disputed-words" },
    7.  son di voi stessi, e saran poi di stelle.

### Declaration on Some Aspects of the Preceding Opinion
[Anonymous (Lodovico Castelvetro)][anon]


\[…\] Someone wrote to him from Rome to know his opinion about this *canzone*, for there it was esteemed by many not only as beautiful but also as such that, had [Petrarch][petrarca] been presented with a similar occasion in his time, he would not have written it differently. However, he, holding a very different opinion from those fervent Roman admirers, replied that [[Petrarch][petrarca] would not have used any of the elements he noted in [Caro][caro]’s *canzone*]{: ana="#s3" }. It is up to others to prove that [Petrarch][petrarca] would have used them, if they wish to charge the opponent with ignorance. But since some of these elements are concisely expressed—having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity—and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent’s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.

First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that [Petrarch][petrarca] would not use the words «[*cede*](#w1-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> II, 10" }», «[*inviolata*](#w6-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> V, 6" }», «[*propizia*](#w8-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 6" }», «[*gesti*](#w10-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VIII, 1" }», «[*inserte*](#w11-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VIII, 6" }», «[*amene*](#w12-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> II, 3" }», «[*simulacri*](#w3-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 15" }», or «[*illustri*](#w9-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 4" }» outside of rhyme, not because these words were unheard of, [since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time]{: ana="#s2" }, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, [that led him to set them aside]{: ana="#s1" }. Nor, similarly, would he use «[*ambo*](#w2-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> I, 3" }» when referring to two feminine referents without the explicit and not implied accompaniment of a noun. Nor would he use «[*ancor essa*](#w4-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 2" }», since refined usage of the language does not admit “*esso*” or “*essa*” with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: «*Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora*» \[Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well\]. But one cannot say: «*Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora*» \[Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well\]. Consequently, one also cannot say: «*Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro ne fa ancor esso*». Nor could one say «[*madre ancor essa*](#w4-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 2" }».

Nor would he use «[*suo merto e tuo valore*](#w5-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> V, 5" }» without “*per*”, since, as far as I recall from my readings, the omission of “*per*” occurs only before three nouns: “*tempo*”, “*grazia*”, and “*mercé*” or “*mercede*”, as in: «*E di notte tempo, con iscale ed altri ingegni, entrò nella città di Cortona*» \[And by night-time, with ladders and other devices, he entered the city of Cortona\]. \[…\] Nor would he use «[*tarpato*](#w7-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 15" }», as it is a plebeian word, never perhaps accepted in any writings except those of [Angelo Poliziano][poliziano]. \[…\]

### Predella’s Resentment
[Predella (Annibal Caro)][predella]


\[…\] But, to answer you point by point, following your order, let us come to what you say in your censure: [that [Petrarch][petrarca] would not use «[*cede*](#w1-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> II, 10" }» and the other words that follow]{: ana="#s3" }. \[…\] [If you were to say that [Petrarch][petrarca] had not used them, one might believe you, for you are well-versed in vocabulary]{: ana="#s1" }. [But in saying outright that «[he would not use them](#parere-1-en){: .q title="<em>Castelvetro’s Opinion</em> I" }», one must consider whether you have reliable authority on the matter, and what exactly you know of it; whether, by chance, as you so freely dispense the name and wisdom of [Petrarch][petrarca], his very spirit has entered your body.]{: ana="#s6 #s7" } For in that case, if you had it by revelation or by some other demonstration, provided it did not come from your own mind, I am content to accept what you say; and [Caro][caro] will admit he used them poorly, [since he holds [Petrarch][petrarca] as the prince of poets in our language, worthy of reverence and admiration above all others.]{: ana="#s4" } [But if it is merely something you say and imagine on your own, I am under no obligation to believe it, and your imagination carries no weight.]{: ana="#s8" }— Nor should one believe you either — you will say. Very well: on this, we are in agreement. It remains that we must agree to refer the matter (as is necessary) to third parties more knowledgeable than both you and I. And to this end, [would you not be satisfied with the judgment, authority, and example of those who are the masters of the art of writing, the very ones from whom [Petrarch][petrarca] and all other good writers have learned]{: ana="#s2 #s9" }, and who should also have taught you to judge, had you read them, or read them well, or interpreted them soundly?

\[…\] But first one must understand the reason why [Petrarch][petrarca], according to you, would not use them. [Because they are Latin?]{: ana="#s15" } Is it then not licit for writers of one language to make use of the words of another? Or do you not know that [they are permitted not only to use those that are foreign and common in the country, as these are]{: ana="#s12 #s14" }; but also to admit those that have never before been written? and the new and the newly invented and the Greek and the barbarous ones, and those twisted from their original form and from their proper meaning at times? and not only the words, but also the figures of speech, transferring them from one language to another, against the rules and against common usage? And who says so? [Castelvetro][castelvetro], perhaps? [It is said by all the good authors of the Greek and Latin languages]{: ana="#s11" }, and by some of our own who write about the art, and it has been put into practice by all those who have written artfully up to now. \[…\]

\[…\] But let us even suppose that [Petrarch][petrarca] did not want to make use of these words because he did not like them. \[…\] But how can you expect an author, no matter how much he writes, to put into use every single word of his era, without leaving behind many others that are just as excellent? That writers after him should be deprived both of the words he left aside and of those that had not yet come into use in his time? [Beyond this, that [Petrarch][petrarca] has taken away from others what he himself did?]{: ana="#s22" } That an entire language should reside in a single author?

### Word faults
[Lodovico Castelvetro][castelvetro]


#### Poor choice of foreign words

Since Latin words are foreign to vernacular speakers, \[…\] I have marked them as not suited to be employed in this *canzone*, and in vain does [Caro][caro] bring forth the authority of the eminent masters of rhetoric and poetry in their support, some of whom do not speak of this kind of foreign words, and some do speak of them, but deny their use or do not allow it in this case; just as he also adduces certain examples of writers and certain arguments that do not pertain to our dispute. \[…\]

As for [Quintilian][quintilian], in saying that [Horace][horace] is «[*et varius figuris et verbis felicissime audax*]{: .q title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> X 1,96" }» \[versatile in his Figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words\] [he means his daring as fortunate only within the bounds of the Latin language, as far as vocabulary is concerned;]{: ana="#s26" } and in saying
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> VIII 3,33" markdown>
nisi quod iniqui iudices adversus nos sumus, ideoque paupertate sermonis laboramus

</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>
except that we are unreasonable critics of ourselves, and consequently suffer from poverty of language

</div>
[he refers to the formation of Latin words after the model of Greek ones, and not to the importing of foreign words \[…\] into another language,]{: ana="#s26" } as [Caro][caro] appears to assume; and in saying in two places «*audendum*» \[one must dare\], [he does not mean it universally of words from every kind of foreign language, but specifically of words newly coined by the orator following the manner of a foreign \[…\] tongue.]{: ana="#s26" } \[…\]

Now, just because, according to [Varro][varro], the role of the orator and that of the poet are not the same in the use of analogy or proportion in words; nor because they are governed by different principles; nor because [the poet is allowed to «[*transilire lineas impune*]{: .q title="Varro, <em>De Lingua Latina</em> IX 5" }», or pass the mark, which [Varro][varro] himself interprets to mean that the poet may follow analogy in words more freely than the orator can;]{: ana="#s27" } it does not follow, as [Caro][caro] assumes, that one should therefore grant the poet the license to mix foreign words \[…\] into his poem, just as it does not follow in the case of [Horace][horace] because he calls usage the begetter of words, or because he says that many words now dead will be reborn, and many that are esteemed will fall into this condition
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Horace, <em>Ars Poetica</em> 71–72" markdown>

si volet usus

quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi



</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>

if Usage so will it,

in whose hands lies the judgement, the right and the rule of speech



</div>
as [Caro][caro] presupposes that one should grant. The power of usage is indeed great in generating new words, in reviving the dead, and in bringing down those that are honored, as [Horace][horace] says, but it is slight or null when it comes to producing artificial words either by signification or by formation, which are the ones under discussion in those Horatian lines
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Horace, <em>Ars Poetica</em> 58–59" markdown>

Licuit semperque licebit

signatum præsente nota producere nomen



</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>

It has ever been, and ever will be,

permitted to issue words stamped with the mint-mark of the day



</div>
as all this liberty in coining words depends entirely on the ingenious daring of the writer, and not on the force of prevailing usage, which [Caro][caro] mistakenly believes. \[…\]

What remains is to see whether, by coming close to the opinion of Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo], who alone has discoursed on such words, and to the example of Italian poets, we may uphold them with merit in the *canzone* where they were placed by [Caro][caro].

But in order to fully understand the opinion of so venerable a writer on this matter, and to know with certainty where and when the use of Latin words in a *canzone* is permitted after the example of Italian poets, I say first that one must select certain authoritative writers to trust regarding the choice of words; or rather, one should acknowledge those that Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo] has already selected, named in his books on the Italian language and cited in confirmation of the things he teaches us. Among them, he judges [Boccaccio][boccaccio] to be the finest prose writer, [Petrarch][petrarca] the finest poet, and both the most recent in time to be worthy of consideration.

Now [Caro][caro] should not be surprised if, since he himself says that our language owes much to the doctrine of [Bembo][bembo] in the choice of words, I refrain from placing much trust in this regard in [Lorenzo de’ Medici][lorenzo-medici], in [Angelo Poliziano][poliziano], or in any other more recent author, since I do so on the advice of [Bembo][bembo] himself, whom [Caro][caro] has approved as a sound counsellor. \[…\]

Volumes, then, disavowed by their authors, however worthy, left to us incomplete, freely criticized by [Bembo][bembo] with regard to their language, or passed over by him in silence, cannot shield us from reproach if we fill our writings with their words, unless those words are also found in other volumes that lack neither final revision, nor the satisfaction of their author, nor the approval of [Bembo][bembo].

Nonetheless, beyond the aforementioned completeness of the volumes, the satisfaction of their authors, and the approval of [Bembo][bembo], it is the advice of [Quintilian][quintilian], in this matter of using Latin or other such words after the example of others, that one should carefully consider, so as not to err in using words which noble authors have placed in their volumes, not so much whether such authors happened to use those particular words, as whether they brought others to share their judgment and gained followers in this regard.

<div class="paraphrase" markdown>


</div>

But whether [Petrarch][petrarca]'s not having used these words \[…\] should be believed to have proceeded from judgment—that is, because he did not deem them worthy of his writings—or from some other circumstance, such as the brevity of his life, or the narrowness or simplicity of his subject matter, as though we ought to think \[…\] that, had he written longer or on other subjects, he would have used other modes of expression and other words; and, just as [Caro][caro] likewise affirms, \[…\] we may almost say that [Petrarch][petrarca] lived a short life, though he passed seventy full years less one day for the most part in good health, comfort, and repose, and occupied with nothing other than the pleasing studies of poetry; and composed few sonnets and *canzoni* on no diverse subject, although he wrote more extensively and with greater variety in this form of verse than did any other who lived before him, or with him, or after him. But, as I say, whether this is to be considered the result of deliberate judgment or of some other cause, it is not necessary at present to say more of it. \[…\]

From the works written in rhyme by [Petrarch][petrarca] in such quantity and over so long a life, it may, I say, most clearly be discerned and safely affirmed which words [Petrarch][petrarca] would have used and which he would not, had he lived longer than he did, or had he written more extensively or on other subjects than he did. Nor is he who claims to discern this, in my opinion, bound to produce a warrant granted by [Petrarch][petrarca] declaring his will and what he would or would not have done in this matter, for greater certainty of another’s unexpressed will, and of what he intended to do or not to do, cannot be had than from the tenor of his other like actions previously preserved by him. Nor, likewise, is he bound to confess that the spirit or soul of [Petrarch][petrarca] passed into his body according to Pythagorean or Kabbalistic metempsychosis, or to boast of having had such knowledge by divine inspiration or revelation, as [Caro][caro] says, jesting at my words «[Petrarch would not use](#parere-1-en){: .q title="<em>Castelvetro’s Opinion</em> I" }», that I am bound to do, since I claim to discern it. But without producing any warrant, or confessing the passage of soul or spirit into a new body, or boasting of divine inspiration or revelation, [Caro][caro] may yet believe me, since, according to his own words, I am well-versed in the vocabulary; and he, who is not so well-versed in it, is mistaken in denying that in [Petrarch][petrarca] are to be found the words “*famelico*”, “*eternare*”, “*lentare*”, because in the vocabulary of my memory “*famelico*” is recorded as said by [Petrarch][petrarca] in the verse \[…\]

<div class="paraphrase" markdown>


</div>

If, then, I did not mark the Latin words in [Caro][caro]’s canzone merely because [Petrarch][petrarca] had not used them, but for other reasons, as clearly appears from what has been said, and was evident even before, it is unjust of him to accuse me of wishing to confine the entire vernacular Italian within the limits set by [Petrarch][petrarca] and [Boccaccio][boccaccio]. And it is belated of him to repeat to me three times, as if it were some great and beautiful secret, unheard of by one of my station, that a living language such as our vernacular, which is still spoken and thus still alive, is not formed for our writing entirely from books, and much less from a single book, as happens with those languages no longer spoken and now dead, except insofar as they live in the books of their authors, such as Latin and Greek. Rather, it is formed in large part also from the usage of many who speak it, as though the Latin words I marked were currently spoken. Now, in saying this, does he not perceive, or does he pretend not to perceive, that he is contradicting Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo], who advises us to write not with the words of the people or of the present age, in whole or in part, but with those of the ancient authors and of their time, in Italian as in any other language, whenever the words of past authors and of past times are better than those of the people or of our present age? Such, according to him, are the words used by [Boccaccio][boccaccio] and [Petrarch][petrarca] and by their century, which he holds to be superior to those that we use today. \[…\]

Moreover, it is unjust that he should be surprised by my judgment, falsely accusing me of thinking that one must necessarily draw the entire language in which we write from the writings of a single author, against the teaching of [Quintilian][quintilian]:
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> X 2,24" markdown>
Sed non qui maxime imitandus, et solus imitandus est

</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>
The author who is most to be imitated is not also the only author to be imitated

</div>
falsely attributing to him—whether out of ignorance or of malice—the intention to speak in that remark of the likeness of words, whereas in fact he speaks of the likeness of the other virtues of the orator, as one will clearly see if they look carefully at that passage. But without attributing to him what he does not believe, I may well be surprised at him, who, in order to turn others against me, also goes so far as to say that proposing [Boccaccio][boccaccio] and [Petrarch][petrarca] as the sole model for writing—supposing that I do indeed propose them as such with regard to language—is nothing else than reducing the whole of the Christian religion to the New Testament, refusing to accept the traditions of the Fathers. These, he says, ought to have a place no less in vernacular Italian than in Christianity, failing to recognize the great difference between the traditions of the holy Christian Fathers and the traditions of his peers, whom he intends to propose to us as Fathers in this language. For whereas the former reveal the glory of the Gospel, restrain the license of dissolute worldly living, and mortify the flesh to give life to the spirit, the latter obscure the clarity of the language, loosen all discipline of measured speech, and exalt and defend ignorance in order to cast down and confound knowledge.
