    6.  perché non sian dall’altro sole estinti,
    7.  del tuo nome dipinti,
    8.  gli sacra, ond’io lor porga eterni pregi:

### Declaration on Some Aspects of the Preceding Opinion 
[Anonymous (Lodovico Castelvetro)][anon]

[...]
Someone wrote to him from Rome to know his opinion about this canzone, for there it was esteemed by many not only as beautiful but also as such that, had [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } been presented with a similar occasion in his time, he would not have written it differently. However, he, holding a very different opinion from those fervent Roman admirers, replied that <span markdown="1" ana="#s3">[Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } would not have used any of the elements he noted in [Caro][caro]{: .persName }’s canzone</span>. It is up to others to prove that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } would have used them, if they wish to charge the opponent with ignorance. But since some of these elements are concisely expressed—having no need to be written differently for the questioner, who understands such brevity—and since their conciseness may, by chance, lead some to regard as puerile and vain what in fact is not, it is appropriate that I, who am aware of the opponent’s intention, expand upon them and clarify them in other words.

First of all, then, the opponent wished to argue that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } would not use the words «[cede](#w1-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> II, 10" }», «[inviolata](#w6-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> V, 6" }», «[propizia](#w8-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 6" }», «[gesti](#w10-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VIII, 1" }», «[inserte](#w11-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VIII, 6" }», «[amene](#w12-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> II, 3" }», «[simulacri](#w3-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 15" }», or «[illustri](#w9-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 4" }» outside of rhyme—not because these words were unheard of, <span markdown="1" ana="#s2">since they had perhaps all, or at least most, been used by writers of his time</span>, but for some other reason, whatever it may have been, <span markdown="1" ana="#s1">that led him to set them aside</span>. Nor, similarly, would he use «[ambo](#w2-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> I, 3" }» when referring to two feminine referents without the explicit—and not implied—accompaniment of a noun. Nor would he use «[ancor essa](#w4-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 2" }», since refined usage of the language does not admit «esso» with an explicit noun unless it precedes it. For instance, as an example: «Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed esso Caro ne fa ancora» (Petrarch writes precious verses, and Caro himself does so as well). But one cannot say: «Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro esso ne fa ancora» (Petrarch writes precious verses, and himself Caro does so as well). Consequently, one also cannot say: «Il Petrarca fa delle rime care, ed il Caro ne fa ancor esso». Nor could one say «[madre ancor essa](#w4-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> III, 2" }».

Nor would he use «[suo merto e tuo valore](#w5-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> V, 5" }» without «per», since, as far as I recall from my readings, the omission of «per» occurs only before three nouns: «tempo», «grazia», and «mercé» or «mercede», as in: «E di notte tempo, con iscale ed altri ingegni, entrò nella città di Cortona». (And by night-time, with ladders and other devices, he entered the city of Cortona.) [...] Nor would he use «[tarpato](#w7-en){: .q title="<em>Venite all’ombra de’ gran gigli d’oro</em> VI, 15" }», as it is a plebeian word, never perhaps accepted in any writings except those of [Angelo Poliziano][poliziano]{: .persName }.

### Predella’s Resentment 
[Predella (Annibal Caro)][predella]


[...] But, to answer you point by point, following your order, let us come to what you say in your censure: <span markdown="1" ana="#s3">that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } would not use «cede» and the other words that follow</span>. [...] <span markdown="1" ana="#s1">If you were to say that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } had not used them, one might believe you, for you are well-versed in vocabulary</span>. <span markdown="1" ana="#s6 #s7">But in saying outright that «[he would not use them](#parere-1-en){: .q title="<em>Castelvetro’s Opinion</em> I, p. 96" }», one must consider whether you have reliable authority on the matter, and what exactly you know of it; whether, by chance, as you so freely dispense the name and wisdom of [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName }, his very spirit has entered your body.</span> For in that case—or if you had it by revelation, or by some other demonstration, provided it did not come from your own mind—I am content to accept what you say; and [Caro][caro]{: .persName } will admit he used them poorly, <span markdown="1" ana="#s4">since he holds [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } as the prince of poets in our language, worthy of reverence and admiration above all others.</span> <span markdown="1" ana="#s8">But if it is merely something you say and imagine on your own, I am under no obligation to believe it, and your imagination carries no weight.</span>— Nor should one believe you either — you will say. Very well: on this, we are in agreement. It remains that we must agree to refer the matter (as is necessary) to third parties more knowledgeable than both you and I. And to this end, <span markdown="1" ana="#s2 #s9">would you not be satisfied with the judgment, authority, and example of those who are the masters of the art of writing</span>—the very ones from whom [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } and all other good writers have learned, and who should also have taught you to judge, had you read them, or read them well, or interpreted them soundly?

[...] But let us even suppose that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } did not want to make use of these words because he did not like them. [...] But how can you expect an author, no matter how much he writes, to put into use every single word of his era, without leaving behind many others that are just as excellent? That writers after him should be deprived both of the words he left aside and of those that had not yet come into use in his time? <span markdown="1" ana="#s22">Beyond this, that [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } has taken away from others what he himself did?</span> That an entire language should reside in a single author? That one alone should judge it? bring it to completion? <span markdown="1" ana="#s19">This is to hold in matters of language the very same belief one holds in matters of faith: to claim that vernacular Italian should be confined to [Petrarch][petrarca]{: .persName } and [Boccaccio][boccaccio]{: .persName }, just as to claim that sacred Scripture is wholly contained in the Gospels and [Saint Paul][st-paul]{: .persName }.</span> [...]
