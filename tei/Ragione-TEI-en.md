### Word faults
[Lodovico Castelvetro][castelvetro]


#### Poor choice of foreign words

Since Latin words are foreign to vernacular speakers, \[…\] I have marked them as not suited to be employed in this *canzone*, and in vain does [Caro][caro] bring forth the authority of the eminent masters of rhetoric and poetry in their support, some of whom do not speak of this kind of foreign words, and some do speak of them, but deny their use or do not allow it in this case; just as he also adduces certain examples of writers and certain arguments that do not pertain to our dispute. \[…\]

As for [Quintilian][quintilian], in saying that [Horace][horace] is «[*et varius figuris et verbis felicissime audax*]{: .q title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> X 1,96" }» \[versatile in his Figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words\] [he means his daring as fortunate only within the bounds of the Latin language, as far as vocabulary is concerned;]{: ana="#s26" } and in saying
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> VIII 3,33" markdown>
nisi quod iniqui iudices adversus nos sumus, ideoque paupertate sermonis laboramus

</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>
except that we are unreasonable critics of ourselves, and consequently suffer from poverty of language

</div>
[he refers to the formation of Latin words after the model of Greek ones, and not to the importing of foreign words \[…\] into another language,]{: ana="#s26" } as [Caro][caro] appears to assume; and in saying in two places «*audendum*» \[one must dare\], [he does not mean it universally of words from every kind of foreign language, but specifically of words newly coined by the speaker following the manner of a foreign \[…\] tongue.]{: ana="#s26" } \[…\]

Now, just because, according to [Varro][varro], the role of the speaker and that of the poet are not the same in the use of analogy or proportion in words; nor because they are governed by different principles; nor because the poet is allowed to «[*transilire lineas impune*]{: .q title="Varro, <em>De Lingua Latina</em> IX 5" }», or pass the mark, which [Varro][varro] himself interprets to mean that the poet may follow analogy in words more freely than the speaker can; it does not follow, as [Caro][caro] assumes, that one should therefore grant the poet the license to mix foreign words \[…\] into his poem, just as it does not follow in the case of [Horace][horace] because he calls usage the begetter of words, or because he says that many words now dead will be reborn, and many that are esteemed will fall into this condition
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Horace, <em>Ars Poetica</em> 71–72" markdown>

si volet usus

quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi



</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>

if Usage so will it,

in whose hands lies the judgement, the right and the rule of speech



</div>
as [Caro][caro] presupposes that one should grant. The power of usage is indeed great in generating new words, in reviving the dead, and in bringing down those that are honored, as [Horace][horace] says, but it is slight or null when it comes to producing artificial words either by signification or by formation, which are the ones under discussion in those Horatian lines
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Horace, <em>Ars Poetica</em> 58–59" markdown>

Licuit semperque licebit

signatum præsente nota producere nomen



</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>

It has ever been, and ever will be,

permitted to issue words stamped with the mint-mark of the day



</div>
as all this liberty in coining words depends entirely on the ingenious daring of the writer, and not on the force of prevailing usage, which [Caro][caro] mistakenly believes. \[…\]

What remains is to see whether, by coming close to the opinion of Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo], who alone has discoursed on such words, and to the example of Italian poets, we may uphold them with merit in the *canzone* where they were placed by [Caro][caro].

But in order to fully understand the opinion of so venerable a writer on this matter, and to know with certainty where and when the use of Latin words in a *canzone* is permitted after the example of Italian poets, I say first that one must select certain authoritative writers to trust regarding the choice of words; or rather, one should acknowledge those that Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo] has already selected, named in his books on the Italian language and cited in confirmation of the things he teaches us. Among them, he judges [Boccaccio][boccaccio] to be the finest prose writer, [Petrarch][petrarca] the finest poet, and both the most recent in time to be worthy of consideration.

Now [Caro][caro] should not be surprised if, since he himself says that our language owes much to the doctrine of [Bembo][bembo] in the choice of words, I refrain from placing much trust in this regard in [Lorenzo de’ Medici][lorenzo-medici], in [Angelo Poliziano][poliziano], or in any other more recent author, since I do so on the advice of [Bembo][bembo] himself, whom [Caro][caro] has approved as a sound counsellor. \[…\]

Volumes, then, disavowed by their authors, however worthy, left to us incomplete, freely criticized by [Bembo][bembo] with regard to their language, or passed over by him in silence, cannot shield us from reproach if we fill our writings with their words, unless those words are also found in other volumes that lack neither final revision, nor the satisfaction of their author, nor the approval of [Bembo][bembo].

Nonetheless, beyond the aforementioned completeness of the volumes, the satisfaction of their authors, and the approval of [Bembo][bembo], it is the advice of [Quintilian][quintilian], in this matter of using Latin or other such words after the example of others, that one should carefully consider, so as not to err in using words which noble authors have placed in their volumes, not so much whether such authors happened to use those particular words, as whether they brought others to share their judgment and gained followers in this regard.

</div>

But whether [Petrarch][petrarca]'s not having used these words \[…\] should be believed to have proceeded from judgment—that is, because he did not deem them worthy of his writings—or from some other circumstance, such as the brevity of his life, or the narrowness or simplicity of his subject matter, as though we ought to think \[…\] that, had he written longer or on other subjects, he would have used other modes of expression and other words; and, just as [Caro][caro] likewise affirms, \[…\] we may almost say that [Petrarch][petrarca] lived a short life, though he passed seventy full years less one day for the most part in good health, comfort, and repose, and occupied with nothing other than the pleasing studies of poetry; and composed few sonnets and *canzoni* on no diverse subject, although he wrote more extensively and with greater variety in this form of verse than did any other who lived before him, or with him, or after him. But, as I say, whether this is to be considered the result of deliberate judgment or of some other cause, it is not necessary at present to say more of it. \[…\]

From the works written in rhyme by [Petrarch][petrarca] in such quantity and over so long a life, it may, I say, most clearly be discerned and safely affirmed which words [Petrarch][petrarca] would have used and which he would not, had he lived longer than he did, or had he written more extensively or on other subjects than he did. Nor is he who claims to discern this, in my opinion, bound to produce a warrant granted by [Petrarch][petrarca] declaring his will and what he would or would not have done in this matter, for greater certainty of another’s unexpressed will, and of what he intended to do or not to do, cannot be had than from the tenor of his other like actions previously preserved by him. Nor, likewise, is he bound to confess that the spirit or soul of [Petrarch][petrarca] passed into his body according to Pythagorean or Kabbalistic metempsychosis, or to boast of having had such knowledge by divine inspiration or revelation, as [Caro][caro] says, jesting at my words «[Petrarch would not use](#parere-1-en){: .q }», that I am bound to do, since I claim to discern it. But without producing any warrant, or confessing the passage of soul or spirit into a new body, or boasting of divine inspiration or revelation, [Caro][caro] may yet believe me, since, according to his own words, I am well-versed in the vocabulary; and he, who is not so well-versed in it, is mistaken in denying that in [Petrarch][petrarca] are to be found the words “*famelico*”, “*eternare*”, “*lentare*”, because in the vocabulary of my memory “*famelico*” is recorded as said by [Petrarch][petrarca] in the verse \[…\]

<div class="paraphrase" markdown>


</div>

If, then, I did not mark the Latin words in [Caro][caro]’s canzone merely because [Petrarch][petrarca] had not used them, but for other reasons, as clearly appears from what has been said, and was evident even before, it is unjust of him to accuse me of wishing to confine the entire vernacular Italian within the limits set by [Petrarch][petrarca] and [Boccaccio][boccaccio]. And it is belated of him to repeat to me three times, as if it were some great and beautiful secret, unheard of by one of my station, that a living language such as our vernacular, which is still spoken and thus still alive, is not formed for our writing entirely from books, and much less from a single book, as happens with those languages no longer spoken and now dead, except insofar as they live in the books of their authors, such as Latin and Greek. Rather, it is formed in large part also from the usage of many who speak it, as though the Latin words I marked were currently spoken. Now, in saying this, does he not perceive, or does he pretend not to perceive, that he is contradicting Messer [Pietro Bembo][bembo], who advises us to write not with the words of the people or of the present age, in whole or in part, but with those of the ancient authors and of their time, in Italian as in any other language, whenever the words of past authors and of past times are better than those of the people or of our present age? Such, according to him, are the words used by [Boccaccio][boccaccio] and [Petrarch][petrarca] and by their century, which he holds to be superior to those that we use today. \[…\]

Moreover, it is unjust that he should be surprised by my judgment, falsely accusing me of thinking that one must necessarily draw the entire language in which we write from the writings of a single author, against the teaching of [Quintilian][quintilian]:
<blockquote class="foreign" title="Quintilian, <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> X 2,24" markdown>
Sed non qui maxime imitandus, et solus imitandus est

</blockquote>

<div class="translation" markdown>
The author who is most to be imitated is not also the only author to be imitated

</div>
falsely attributing to him—whether out of ignorance or of malice—the intention to speak in that remark of the likeness of words, whereas in fact he speaks of the likeness of the other virtues of the speaker, as one will clearly see if they look carefully at that passage. But without attributing to him what he does not believe, I may well be surprised at him, who, in order to turn others against me, also goes so far as to say that proposing [Boccaccio][boccaccio] and [Petrarch][petrarca] as the sole model for writing—supposing that I do indeed propose them as such with regard to language—is nothing else than reducing the whole of the Christian religion to the New Testament, refusing to accept the traditions of the Fathers. These, he says, ought to have a place no less in vernacular Italian than in Christianity, failing to recognize the great difference between the traditions of the holy Christian Fathers and the traditions of his peers, whom he intends to propose to us as Fathers in this language. For whereas the former reveal the glory of the Gospel, restrain the license of dissolute worldly living, and mortify the flesh to give life to the spirit, the latter obscure the clarity of the language, loosen all discipline of measured speech, and exalt and defend ignorance in order to cast down and confound knowledge.
